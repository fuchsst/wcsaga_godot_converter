# EPIC-003: Audio Asset Conversion (WAV/OGG â†’ Ogg Vorbis)

## PRD Reference
[PRD-001: Data Converter System](../prds/PRD-001-data-converter-system.md)

## Technical Scope
Convert all audio assets (WAV/OGG) to Ogg Vorbis format optimized for Godot's audio system. This includes spatialized sound effects, music tracks, and UI audio with appropriate compression settings.

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Audio file format detection and metadata extraction
- Implement WAV/OGG format detection with comprehensive metadata extraction
- Extract loop points and 3D positioning data for spatial audio
- Handle various bit depths and sample rates in source files

### Phase 2: Conversion pipeline with quality-preserving resampling
- Convert WAV files to Ogg Vorbis with appropriate settings for platform compatibility
- Standardize sample rates and bit depths for consistent audio quality
- Implement quality-preserving resampling algorithms

### Phase 3: Spatial audio property mapping for 3D sound effects
- Preserve loop points and 3D positioning data for spatial audio
- Map legacy audio properties to Godot's audio system
- Handle audio event definitions and mappings from foundation data

### Phase 4: Batch processing with progress tracking and validation
- Implement batch processing for large-scale audio conversion
- Add progress tracking and detailed status information
- Validate converted files for proper playback and metadata

## Acceptance Criteria
- All audio assets converted to Ogg Vorbis without quality loss
- Spatial audio properties correctly mapped for 3D positioning
- File sizes reduced by at least 30% compared to uncompressed formats
- Godot AudioStreamPlayer nodes can load converted assets
- Loop points and positioning data preserved accurately

## Agent Assignments
- **asset-pipeline-engineer**: Audio format parsing and conversion

- **qa_engineer**: Audio quality validation and performance testing

## Success Metrics
- 100% of audio assets converted
- Average 40% reduction in audio file sizes
- <5ms loading time for individual audio resources
- Audio quality preservation with minimal artifacts
- Proper integration with Godot's 3D audio system
