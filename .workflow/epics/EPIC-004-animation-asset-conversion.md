# EPIC-004: Animation Asset Conversion (ANI â†’ Sprite Sheets/Animation Resources)

## PRD Reference
[PRD-001: Data Converter System](../prds/PRD-001-data-converter-system.md)

## Technical Scope
Convert Wing Commander's proprietary ANI animation format to Godot sprite sheets and Animation resources. This includes cockpit animations, UI elements, and visual effects with proper timing and frame sequencing.

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: ANI format parser with frame extraction capabilities
- Implement ANI format parser with complete frame extraction
- Extract animation frame sequences preserving timing data
- Handle various ANI file variants and compression schemes

### Phase 2: Sprite sheet generation with optimal packing algorithms
- Generate optimized sprite sheet textures with efficient packing
- Create texture atlases with proper UV coordinates
- Handle different frame sizes and aspect ratios

### Phase 3: Animation resource creation with timing and loop properties
- Create Godot Animation resources with frame timing and sequence information
- Implement loop properties and animation blending
- Map legacy animation properties to Godot's animation system

### Phase 4: Integration with Godot's AnimationPlayer system
- Ensure compatibility with Godot's AnimationPlayer and AnimatedSprite nodes
- Implement proper resource referencing and loading
- Organize by animation type and usage context following the hybrid model

## Acceptance Criteria
- All ANI files successfully converted to sprite sheets
- Frame timing and sequencing preserved accurately
- Animation resources compatible with Godot's animation system
- Memory usage optimized for runtime performance
- Proper integration with Godot's node-based animation system

## Agent Assignments
- **asset-pipeline-engineer**: ANI parsing and sprite sheet generation
- **godot-systems-designer**: Animation resource creation and integration
- **qa_engineer**: Animation quality validation and performance testing

## Success Metrics
- 98%+ of animations successfully converted
- <10% increase in memory usage compared to original format
- 60 FPS playback performance on target hardware
- Timing accuracy preserved within 1 frame tolerance
- Proper resource organization following hybrid model
