# EPIC-006: Mission Integration Conversion (FS2/FC2 â†’ Godot Scenes/Resources)

## PRD Reference
[PRD-001: Data Converter System](../prds/PRD-001-data-converter-system.md)

## Technical Scope
Convert Wing Commander Saga mission files (FS2/FC2) to Godot scenes and resources. This includes mission structure, briefing data, objectives, spawn points, and AI behavior definitions mapped to Godot's node system.

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Mission file parser with structure and objective extraction
- Implement FS2/FC2 binary format parser with complete data extraction
- Extract briefing, placement, and event data from mission files
- Parse FC2 campaign files for mission sequencing and progression data

### Phase 2: Node-based scene generation with proper hierarchy
- Generate Godot scenes with entity references using instance() calls
- Create proper node hierarchy reflecting mission structure
- Handle mission-specific asset references and dependencies

### Phase 3: AI behavior mapping to Godot script resources
- Map legacy AI behaviors to Godot script resources
- Implement event timeline using Godot's animation system
- Handle AI profiles and tactical behavior definitions

### Phase 4: Integration with Godot's scene instancing system
- Link to all converted data and media assets through exported variables
- Ensure compatibility with Godot's scene instancing and loading
- Implement proper resource referencing and dependency management

## Acceptance Criteria
- All mission files converted to Godot scenes without data loss
- Objectives and briefing data correctly displayed in-game
- AI behaviors function as intended in converted missions
- Mission loading performance meets target specifications
- Proper integration with Godot's scene and resource system

## Agent Assignments
- **asset-pipeline-engineer**: Mission file parsing and data extraction
- **godot-systems-designer**: Scene generation and AI behavior mapping
- **qa-engineer**: Mission functionality validation and performance testing

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ of missions successfully converted
- <3 second loading time for average mission
- Zero critical errors in mission execution
- Proper objective tracking and completion detection
- AI behavior accuracy matching original implementation
