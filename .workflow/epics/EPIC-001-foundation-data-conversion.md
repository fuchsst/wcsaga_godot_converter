# EPIC-001: Foundation Data Conversion (.tbl â†’ .tres)

## PRD Reference
[PRD-001: Data Converter System](../prds/PRD-001-data-converter-system.md)

## Technical Scope
Convert Wing Commander Saga's tabular data files (.tbl) to Godot's resource format (.tres). This includes ship definitions, weapon statistics, armor specifications, species characteristics, IFF relationships, AI profiles, and other configuration data that drives game mechanics. The conversion process handles base table files (.tbl) only.

Specific table types to be converted:
- Ships (.tbl) - Ship class definitions with physics, weapons, and visual properties
- Weapons (.tbl) - Weapon definitions with damage, firing rates, and effects
- Armor (.tbl) - Armor type definitions with damage reduction properties
- Species (.tbl) - Species definitions and relationships
- IFF (.tbl) - IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) relationship definitions
- AI Profiles (.tbl) - AI behavior characteristics and combat parameters
- Fireballs (.tbl) - Fireball/explosion effect definitions
- Lightning (.tbl) - Lightning/electrical effect definitions
- Asteroids (.tbl) - Asteroid field definitions and properties
- Stars (.tbl) - Starfield and background definitions
- Medals (.tbl) - Medal definitions with visual representations
- Ranks (.tbl) - Military rank definitions with promotion requirements
- Sounds (.tbl) - Sound effect definitions with file references
- Music (.tbl) - Music track definitions for campaign events
- Cutscenes (.tbl) - Cutscene definitions with audio file references
- Scripting (.tbl) - Scripting system definitions and hooks

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Parser development for .tbl binary formats
- Implement specialized parsers for all 16 TBL file variants using regex-based parsing
- Extract all gameplay-relevant data fields accurately with validation
- Support comment handling, multi-line values, and inline documentation
- Implement robust error handling for malformed or corrupted source data

### Phase 2: Data structure mapping to Godot-compatible classes
- Map legacy data structures to Godot Resource classes using data-driven design
- Implement comprehensive data validation with type checking and range validation
- Maintain cross-references between related table entries with relationship mapping
- Handle data type conversions (strings, integers, floats, booleans, vectors, arrays)
- Create unified data structures for consistent resource generation

### Phase 3: .tres serialization with proper resource referencing
- Generate Godot-compatible .tres files with proper metadata and format compliance
- Implement ResourceLoader integration for cross-references with exported variables
- Organize files in hybrid directory structure following Global Litmus Test principle
- Create individual resource files for each entity (ships, weapons, etc.) rather than monolithic databases
- Implement proper naming conventions and file organization per Godot best practices

### Phase 4: Validation and error handling for corrupted data
- Implement comprehensive validation for data integrity with detailed error reporting
- Add graceful degradation for invalid source data with fallback mechanisms
- Create detailed logging for debugging and troubleshooting with line number tracking
- Implement conversion summary reports with statistics and error analysis
- Add asset relationship mapping for cross-reference validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- All 16 .tbl file types successfully parsed without data loss
- Generated .tres files load correctly in Godot engine with format compliance
- Data integrity maintained through conversion process with validation checks
- Error handling for malformed or missing source files with detailed logging
- Cross-references between related table entries properly maintained and validated
- Individual resource files generated for each entity following Godot conventions
- Asset relationship mapping created for all cross-references and dependencies
- Conversion summary reports generated with statistics and error analysis

## Agent Assignments
- **asset-pipeline-engineer**: Format parsing and data extraction
- **godot-systems-designer**: Resource mapping, serialization, and Godot integration
- **qa-engineer**: Validation, quality assurance, and cross-reference integrity testing

## Success Metrics
- 100% of foundation data files converted with zero data corruption incidents
- <1ms load time for converted resources in Godot engine
- All cross-references validated and functional with relationship mapping
- Format compliance with Godot .tres specifications verified
- Asset relationship mapping successfully created for all dependencies
- Conversion summary reports generated with comprehensive statistics
- Error rate < 0.1% across all converted table entries
- Memory usage during conversion < 2GB peak for large datasets
