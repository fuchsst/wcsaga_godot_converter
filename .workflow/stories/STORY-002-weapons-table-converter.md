# STORY-002: Implement Weapons Table Converter

## User Story
As an asset pipeline engineer, I want to convert weapons.tbl/.tbm files to Godot .tres resources so that weapon definitions are available in the Godot engine with all their properties and effects.

## Epic Reference
[EPIC-001: Foundation Data Conversion (.tbl â†’ .tres)](../epics/EPIC-001-foundation-data-conversion.md)

## Godot Implementation
- Create a WeaponTableConverter class that extends BaseTableConverter
- Parse weapon definitions with damage statistics (hull, armor, shield damage)
- Extract firing properties (rate of fire, energy consumption, heat generation)
- Handle projectile characteristics (muzzle velocity, lifetime, range)
- Process visual effect references (muzzle flashes, impact effects, animations)
- Extract audio asset references (fire sounds, impact sounds)
- Handle weapon class categorization and targeting properties
- Map parsed data to Godot Resource classes with exported variables
- Generate individual .tres files for each weapon type following Godot conventions
- Organize output files in `/assets/campaigns/wing_commander_saga/weapons/` directory

## Implementation Tasks
- [task-001](../tasks/task-001-refactor-weapontableconverter.md): Refactor WeaponTableConverter class with SOLID principles
- [task-002](../tasks/task-002-weapon-physics-parsing.md): Implement comprehensive weapon physics and damage property parsing
- [task-003](../tasks/task-003-weapon-categorization-parsing.md): Implement weapon class categorization and targeting properties parsing
- [task-004](../tasks/task-004-weapon-asset-reference-mapping.md): Implement visual and audio asset reference extraction and mapping
- [task-005](../tasks/task-005-weapon-godot-generation.md): Implement WeaponResourceGenerator and Godot .tres file generation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WeaponTableConverter successfully parses weapons.tbl files with all properties
- [ ] All damage and firing properties are correctly extracted and validated
- [ ] Projectile characteristics are properly parsed and stored
- [ ] Visual and audio asset references are captured for asset mapping
- [ ] Individual .tres files are generated for each weapon type
- [ ] Generated resources load correctly in Godot engine
- [ ] Cross-references to other table entries are maintained
- [ ] Format compliance with Godot .tres specifications is verified
- [ ] Unit tests cover all parsing and conversion functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WeaponTableConverter class implemented with full parsing capability
- [ ] Resource generation produces valid Godot .tres files
- [ ] Asset relationship mapping created for effect and audio references
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >90% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end conversion process
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage examples
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to main branch
