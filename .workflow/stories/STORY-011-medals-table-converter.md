# STORY-011: Implement Medals Table Converter

## User Story
As an asset pipeline engineer, I want to convert medals.tbl/.tbm files to Godot .tres resources so that medal definitions with visual representations are available in the Godot engine.

## Epic Reference
[EPIC-001: Foundation Data Conversion (.tbl/.tbm â†’ .tres)](../epics/EPIC-001-foundation-data-conversion.md)

## Godot Implementation
- Create a MedalsTableConverter class that extends BaseTableConverter
- Parse medal definitions with achievement criteria and visual properties
- Extract medal properties (names, descriptions, icon references, award criteria)
- Handle medal categorization and progression associations
- Map parsed data to Godot Resource classes with exported variables
- Generate individual .tres files for each medal following Godot conventions
- Organize output files in `/assets/campaigns/wing_commander_saga/ui/medals/` directory

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MedalsTableConverter successfully parses medals.tbl files with all properties
- [ ] TBM inheritance correctly merges with base medal definitions
- [ ] All medal characteristics are correctly extracted and validated
- [ ] Medal categorization and progression associations are properly maintained
- [ ] Individual .tres files are generated for each medal
- [ ] Generated resources load correctly in Godot engine
- [ ] Cross-references to other table entries are maintained
- [ ] Format compliance with Godot .tres specifications is verified
- [ ] Unit tests cover all parsing and conversion functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] MedalsTableConverter class implemented with full parsing capability
- [ ] Resource generation produces valid Godot .tres files
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >90% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end conversion process
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage examples
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to main branch
