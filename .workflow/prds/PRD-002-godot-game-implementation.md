# PRD-002: Godot Game Implementation

## Business Context
The Godot Game Implementation PRD defines the comprehensive recreation of Wing Commander Saga gameplay systems within the Godot 4.x engine. This product represents the core deliverable of the migration project, transforming the converted assets into a fully playable game that preserves the authentic Wing Commander experience while incorporating modern enhancements. The implementation builds directly upon the Data Converter System (PRD-001) and represents the primary value proposition for end users.

## Technical Scope
The Godot Game Implementation encompasses all core gameplay systems necessary to deliver a complete Wing Commander experience:

### Core Gameplay Systems
- **6DOF Space Combat**: Full six degrees of freedom flight simulation with momentum-based physics
- **Weapon Systems**: Primary/secondary weapons with heat management and species-specific technologies
- **Damage Modeling**: Subsystem targeting with critical component damage and visual effects
- **AI Systems**: Enemy and wingman AI with species-specific tactical behaviors
- **Mission System**: Campaign structure with dynamic mission generation and progression tracking

### Technical Architecture
- **Node Structure**: Hierarchical scene organization following Godot best practices
- **Component Design**: Modular systems for ships, weapons, and effects with extensibility
- **Resource Management**: Efficient asset loading and streaming for large space environments
- **Performance Optimization**: LOD systems, occlusion culling, and memory management

### User Experience
- **Cockpit & HUD**: Species-specific cockpits with interactive elements and dynamic HUD
- **Menus & UI**: Comprehensive interface system with settings, loadouts, and mission briefings
- **Audio System**: 3D spatialized audio with dynamic music and voice acting support
- **Modern Enhancements**: Visual improvements with post-processing and accessibility options

## Success Criteria
- **Performance**: Minimum 60 FPS in combat scenarios (1080p) with load times under 10 seconds
- **Feature Completeness**: Implementation of all core gameplay systems with 95% feature parity
- **Platform Support**: Cross-platform compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **User Satisfaction**: Player retention rate of 30% after first week with 4/5 average satisfaction
- **Technical Quality**: <1 critical bug per 100 hours of gameplay with fast iteration times

## Dependencies
- **PRD-001 (Data Converter System)**: Requires fully converted assets and resources
- **Godot 4.x Engine**: Dependency on Godot's features and capabilities
- **Asset Pipeline**: Integration with converted asset formats and directory structure
- **Testing Framework**: GDUnit4 for quality assurance and validation

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: Very high complexity in implementing realistic 6DOF physics and AI systems
  - *Mitigation*: Prototype core systems early, implement iterative development with frequent testing
- **Performance Requirements**: Challenging performance targets for large space scenes with many entities
  - *Mitigation*: Implement profiling tools early, optimize critical systems, use Godot's built-in features
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensuring consistent experience across different operating systems
  - *Mitigation*: Regular testing on all platforms, use Godot's cross-platform capabilities
- **Development Timeline**: 48-week timeline with complex dependencies and integration challenges
  - *Mitigation*: Phased implementation approach, regular milestone reviews, contingency planning
