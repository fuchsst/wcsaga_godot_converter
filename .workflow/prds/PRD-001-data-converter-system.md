# PRD-001: Data Converter System

## Business Context

The Wing Commander Saga to Godot migration requires a comprehensive data conversion pipeline to transform legacy assets from the original C++ FreeSpace Open engine into modern Godot-compatible formats. This conversion forms the critical foundation that enables the entire migration project, as Godot implementation cannot begin until assets are properly converted and validated.

The data converter system addresses the core business need to preserve 20+ years of community-created content while modernizing it for current gaming platforms. Without this conversion capability, the valuable Wing Commander Saga content would remain locked in obsolete formats, preventing community access and future development.

## Technical Scope

The Data Converter System encompasses the complete asset conversion pipeline for six major asset categories:

### 1. Foundation Data Conversion (.tbl → .tres)
- Parse custom TBL format
- Convert to Godot Resource properties using data-driven design  
- Handle ship definitions, weapon specifications, AI profiles, species data
- Maintain cross-references between related table entries through ResourceLoader
- Organize in hybrid directory structure following Global Litmus Test principle

### 2. Visual Asset Conversion (POF/PCX/DDS → glTF/WebP)
- Parse POF geometry and convert to glTF 2.0 preserving model hierarchy
- Extract hardpoint and subsystem metadata for gameplay systems
- Convert PCX/DDS paletted/images to RGB/RGBA with transparency
- Generate optimized textures with mipmaps for performance
- Create sprite sheets for animations with timing data

### 3. Audio Asset Conversion (WAV/OGG → Ogg Vorbis)
- Convert WAV files to Ogg Vorbis with appropriate settings for platform compatibility
- Standardize sample rates and bit depths for consistent audio quality
- Preserve loop points and 3D positioning data for spatial audio
- Organize by content type and usage context following the Global Litmus Test

### 4. Animation Asset Conversion (ANI → Sprite Sheets/Animation Resources)
- Extract animation frame sequences from ANI files preserving timing data
- Generate optimized sprite sheet textures with efficient packing
- Create Godot Animation resources with frame timing and sequence information
- Organize by animation type and usage context following the hybrid model

### 5. Text Asset Conversion (TXT → BBCode)
- Parse custom formatting codes in TXT files preserving narrative structure
- Convert to BBCode for Godot RichTextLabel compatibility with formatting preservation
- Structure content for navigation and search with metadata generation
- Organize by campaign and mission following campaign-centric principles

### 6. Mission Integration Conversion (FS2/FC2 → Godot Scenes/Resources)
- Parse binary FS2 mission format extracting briefing, placement, and event data
- Parse FC2 campaign files for mission sequencing and progression data
- Generate Godot scenes with entity references using instance() calls
- Create event timeline using Godot's animation system with timeline sequences
- Link to all converted data and media assets through exported variables

## Success Criteria

### Data Accuracy and Completeness
- **100% asset coverage**: All TBL, POF, PCX, WAV, ANI, TXT, FS2, and FC2 files successfully converted
- **Data integrity**: All gameplay-relevant values preserved with precision during conversion
- **Cross-reference validity**: All asset relationships maintained and verifiable through automated testing
- **Format compliance**: All output files conform to Godot format specifications

### Quality Standards
- **Visual fidelity**: Converted 3D models and textures maintain visual quality indistinguishable from originals
- **Audio quality**: Converted audio preserves original characteristics with minimal quality loss
- **Performance optimization**: Converted assets meet target performance metrics (60 FPS, <2GB memory)
- **Validation coverage**: 100% of converted assets pass automated quality validation tests

### Technical Validation
- **Format verification**: All .tres, .glb, .webp, .ogg files load correctly in Godot
- **Asset organization**: Files properly organized according to hybrid directory structure
- **Metadata preservation**: Gameplay-relevant metadata (hardpoints, timing, positioning) preserved
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation for invalid source data with comprehensive logging

### Pipeline Efficiency
- **Conversion speed**: Complete asset conversion pipeline completes within 4 hours for full game content
- **Memory efficiency**: Conversion process remains under 8GB peak memory usage
- **Parallel processing**: Support for concurrent conversion of independent asset categories
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time conversion progress reporting with detailed status information

## Dependencies

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
- **Format parsing complexity**: Legacy POF and ANI formats have complex internal structures
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing with diverse asset samples, reference implementation validation
- **Asset quality degradation**: Risk of visual/audio quality loss during conversion
  - *Mitigation*: Quality comparison tooling, side-by-side validation, lossless conversion where possible
- **Cross-reference integrity**: Complex asset relationships may break during conversion
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive relationship mapping, automated validation, rollback capability

### Medium-Risk Areas  
- **Performance impact**: Converted assets may not meet performance targets
  - *Mitigation*: Performance profiling during conversion, optimization strategies, fallback options
- **Memory constraints**: Large asset sets may exceed available system memory during conversion
  - *Mitigation*: Streaming conversion, chunked processing, memory monitoring and optimization
- **Conversion errors**: Malformed source assets may cause conversion failures
  - *Mitigation*: Robust error handling, detailed logging, manual intervention capabilities

### Low-Risk Areas
