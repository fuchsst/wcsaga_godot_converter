## Quality Metrics

### Quality Dashboard
- **Code Quality**: 9/10 (→ stable)
- **Test Coverage**: 90% (→ stable)
- **Technical Debt**: Low (→ stable)

### Recent Quality Trends
- Linting issues: 409 (↑ from previous)
- Failed tests: 0 (→ stable)
- Performance regressions: 0 (→ stable)
- Security issues: 0 (→ stable)

## Critical Issues & Blockers

### Critical Issues (Immediate Attention Required)
1. **Import Error**: Validation module has import error - `TestQualityGate` class is named `QualityGate` in the implementation
   - **Impact**: Blocks test execution and validation
   - **Assigned**: migration-architect
   - **Recommendation**: Rename class to match import or update import statement

### Blockers & Dependencies
- **Cross-team Dependencies**: 0 waiting
- **Technical Blockers**: 1 requiring immediate attention (import error)

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. **Priority 1**: Fix import error in validation module to restore test execution
2. **Priority 2**: Begin implementation of STORY-003: Armor Table Converter
3. **Priority 3**: Continue with remaining table converters in EPIC-001

### Process Improvements
1. **Quality Assurance**: Implement automated import validation to catch these errors earlier
2. **Velocity**: Consider parallel implementation of multiple table converters
3. **Risk Management**: Monitor dependencies between EPIC-001 and downstream epics

### Resource Optimization
1. **Agent Utilization**: Asset pipeline engineer has capacity for multiple stories
2. **Skill Gaps**: Current team composition is well-suited for table converter work
3. **Bottlenecks**: Minor bottleneck with validation system error

## Next Milestones
1. **STORY-003 Implementation**: Armor Table Converter (Estimated: 2 days)
2. **EPIC-001 Completion**: All 16 table converters (Estimated: 4 weeks)
3. **EPIC-002 Kickoff**: Visual Asset Conversion planning (Depends on EPIC-001)

## Summary
The project has made good progress with the successful completion of STORY-001 and STORY-002. Both stories passed all validation criteria, demonstrating the team's capability to implement table converters effectively. With 2 stories completed out of 16 in EPIC-001, the project is now 12.5% complete overall. 

However, there is a critical import error in the validation system that needs immediate attention to restore full testing capabilities. Once this is resolved, the team can continue with the implementation of the remaining table converters in parallel, which should help increase velocity.
