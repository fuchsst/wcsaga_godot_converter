None at this time.

### Blockers & Dependencies
- **Cross-team Dependencies**: 0 waiting
- **Technical Blockers**: 0 requiring architecture decisions

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. **Priority 1**: Begin implementation of STORY-002: Weapons Table Converter
2. **Priority 2**: Continue with remaining table converters in EPIC-001
3. **Priority 3**: Prepare for EPIC-002: Visual Asset Conversion planning

### Process Improvements
1. **Quality Assurance**: Continue maintaining high test coverage
2. **Velocity**: Consider parallel implementation of multiple table converters
3. **Risk Management**: Monitor dependencies between EPIC-001 and downstream epics

### Resource Optimization
1. **Agent Utilization**: Asset pipeline engineer has capacity for multiple stories
2. **Skill Gaps**: Current team composition is well-suited for table converter work
3. **Bottlenecks**: No current bottlenecks identified

## Next Milestones
1. **STORY-002 Implementation**: Weapons Table Converter (Estimated: 3 days)
2. **EPIC-001 Completion**: All 16 table converters (Estimated: 4 weeks)
3. **EPIC-002 Kickoff**: Visual Asset Conversion planning (Depends on EPIC-001)

## Summary
The project is off to a strong start with the successful completion of STORY-001: Implement Ships Table Converter. All validation criteria were met, and comprehensive testing was completed. The team has demonstrated excellent quality standards with 100% test pass rate and high code quality scores. With 1 story completed out of 16 in EPIC-001, the project is 6.25% complete overall. The foundation for data conversion is solid, and the team is well-positioned to continue with the remaining table converters.
