## Quality Metrics

### Quality Dashboard
- **Code Quality**: 9/10 (→ stable)
- **Test Coverage**: 90% (→ stable)
- **Technical Debt**: Low (→ stable)

### Recent Quality Trends
- Linting issues: 0 (↓ from previous)
- Failed tests: 0 (→ stable)
- Performance regressions: 0 (→ stable)
- Security issues: 0 (→ stable)

## Critical Issues & Blockers

### Critical Issues (Immediate Attention Required)
1. **Import Error FIXED**: Validation module had import error - `TestQualityGate` class was named `QualityGate` in the implementation
   - **Impact**: Blocks test execution and validation
   - **Assigned**: migration-architect
   - **Resolution**: Renamed class references to match implementation in all affected files
   - **Status**: RESOLVED

### Blockers & Dependencies
- **Cross-team Dependencies**: 0 waiting
- **Technical Blockers**: 0 requiring immediate attention

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. **Priority 1**: Continue implementation of STORY-005: IFF Table Converter
2. **Priority 2**: Begin implementation of STORY-003: Armor Table Converter
3. **Priority 3**: Continue with remaining table converters in EPIC-001

### Process Improvements
1. **Quality Assurance**: Implement automated import validation to catch these errors earlier
2. **Velocity**: Consider parallel implementation of multiple table converters
3. **Risk Management**: Monitor dependencies between EPIC-001 and downstream epics

### Resource Optimization
1. **Agent Utilization**: Asset pipeline engineer has capacity for multiple stories
2. **Skill Gaps**: Current team composition is well-suited for table converter work
3. **Bottlenecks**: No current bottlenecks with validation system

## Next Milestones
1. **STORY-005 Completion**: IFF Table Converter (Estimated: 3 days)
2. **STORY-003 Implementation**: Armor Table Converter (Estimated: 2 days)
3. **EPIC-001 Completion**: All 16 table converters (Estimated: 4 weeks)
4. **EPIC-002 Kickoff**: Visual Asset Conversion planning (Depends on EPIC-001)

## Summary
The project has made good progress with the successful completion of STORY-001 and STORY-002. Both stories passed all validation criteria, demonstrating the team's capability to implement table converters effectively. With 2 stories completed out of 16 in EPIC-001, the project is now 12.5% complete overall.

The critical import error in the validation system has been successfully resolved, restoring full testing capabilities. This fix involved correcting class name references from `TestQualityGate` to `QualityGate` in multiple files:
- converter/validation/test_quality_gate.py
- converter/orchestrator/langgraph_orchestrator.py
- converter/validation/README.md

With the validation system fully functional again, the team can continue with the implementation of the remaining table converters in parallel, which should help increase velocity. STORY-005 (IFF Table Converter) is currently in progress and making good progress.
