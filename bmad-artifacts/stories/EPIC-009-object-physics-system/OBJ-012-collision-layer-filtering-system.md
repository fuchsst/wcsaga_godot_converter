# User Story: Collision Layer and Filtering System

## Story Definition
**As a**: Collision system developer  
**I want**: Sophisticated collision layer and filtering system with rule-based collision management  
**So that**: Different object types interact appropriately while preventing unnecessary collision processing between incompatible objects

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: Collision layer system defines clear categories (ships, weapons, debris, triggers, environment)
- [x] **AC2**: Collision filtering rules prevent inappropriate interactions (e.g., friendly fire settings)
- [x] **AC3**: Dynamic collision mask management allows runtime changes to collision behavior
- [x] **AC4**: Collision categories support WCS object relationships and interaction rules
- [x] **AC5**: Performance optimization reduces collision processing through intelligent filtering
- [x] **AC6**: Debug visualization shows collision layers and active collision relationships

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Collision filtering from architecture.md lines 124-127, collision categories
- **Godot Components**: Physics layers and masks, collision detection filtering, bitwise operations
- **Performance Targets**: Collision filtering under 0.01ms per object, layer changes under 0.05ms  
- **Integration Points**: BaseSpaceObject collision properties, collision detection system, object types

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/objcollide.cpp` collision filtering and object interaction systems
- **Godot Approach**: Godot's physics layer and mask system with WCS-specific collision rules
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining flexible collision rules while optimizing performance
- **Success Metrics**: Proper collision filtering, reduced unnecessary collision checks, flexible rules

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-009 collision detection, OBJ-010 collision response systems
- **Blockers**: None (uses standard Godot collision layer capabilities)
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-009 (Collision Detection), OBJ-010 (Collision Response)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [x] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [x] Unit tests written covering collision filtering, layer management, and rule enforcement
- [x] Performance targets achieved for collision filtering operations
- [x] Integration testing with different object types and interaction scenarios completed
- [x] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [x] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for collision filtering system
