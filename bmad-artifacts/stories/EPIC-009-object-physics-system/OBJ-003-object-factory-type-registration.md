# User Story: Object Factory and Type Registration System

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game system developer  
**I want**: A comprehensive object factory system with type registration and creation templates  
**So that**: Different space object types can be created efficiently with proper configuration and asset integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: SpaceObjectFactory provides unified interface for creating all space object types
- [ ] **AC2**: MANDATORY: Object type registration MUST use `addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/object_types.gd` exclusively
- [ ] **AC3**: Factory integrates with existing wcs_asset_core addon for loading object configuration data and asset definitions
- [ ] **AC4**: Object type registration system supports ships, weapons, debris, asteroids, and environmental objects from wcs_asset_core
- [ ] **AC5**: Creation templates define default properties, components, and physics profiles for each object type using addon resources
- [ ] **AC6**: Factory supports both immediate creation and deferred initialization patterns
- [ ] **AC7**: Error handling and validation ensure only valid objects are created with proper fallbacks
- [ ] **AC8**: Integration with EPIC-004 SEXP system for dynamic object creation from mission scripts

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: SpaceObjectFactory from godot-files.md line 19, integration with wcs_asset_core
- **EPIC-002 Integration**: MANDATORY use of wcs_asset_core addon for ALL object type definitions and creation data
- **Required Imports**: 
  - `const ObjectTypes = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/object_types.gd")`
  - `const ObjectTypeData = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/structures/object_type_data.gd")`
  - `const PhysicsProfile = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/object/physics_profile.gd")`
- **Godot Components**: Factory pattern implementation, Resource system integration, scene instantiation
- **Performance Targets**: Object creation under 0.2ms for simple objects, under 1ms for complex objects  
- **Integration Points**: wcs_asset_core addon (EPIC-002), ObjectManager registration, BaseSpaceObject, EPIC-004 SEXP interface

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp` object creation systems and type management
- **Godot Approach**: Factory pattern with Resource-based configuration and scene templates
- **Key Challenges**: Efficient object creation while maintaining flexibility and asset integration
- **Success Metrics**: Fast object creation, proper asset integration, extensible type system

## Dependencies
- **CRITICAL Prerequisites**: 
  - OBJ-000 Asset Core Integration Prerequisites (MANDATORY FIRST)
  - OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject class, OBJ-002 enhanced ObjectManager
- **Blockers**: EPIC-002 wcs_asset_core addon must be available for asset integration
- **Integration Dependencies**:
  - EPIC-002 wcs_asset_core addon with object type definitions
  - EPIC-004 SEXP system for mission-driven object creation
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-001 (BaseSpaceObject), OBJ-002 (ObjectManager), OBJ-004 (Serialization)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [x] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [x] Unit tests written covering object creation, type registration, and error handling
- [x] Performance targets achieved for object creation operations

## STORY STATUS: COMPLETED ✅

**Implementation Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Implemented By**: Dev (GDScript Developer via BMAD)

### Implementation Summary
**Enhanced SpaceObjectFactory**: `/target/scripts/core/objects/space_object_factory.gd` (567 lines)
- ✅ Comprehensive factory interface supporting all WCS object types through ObjectTypes.Type enum (AC1)
- ✅ MANDATORY wcs_asset_core integration - NO local type definitions, uses addon constants exclusively (AC2)
- ✅ Complete asset loading integration with WCSAssetLoader for ship/weapon data (AC3)
- ✅ Type registration system supporting ships, weapons, debris, asteroids, and all environmental objects (AC4)
- ✅ Creation templates with default properties, physics profiles, and configuration inheritance (AC5)
- ✅ Immediate and deferred initialization patterns with proper lifecycle management (AC6)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with validation, fallbacks, and informative error messages (AC7)
- ✅ SEXP system integration for dynamic object creation from mission scripts (AC8)

**Test Implementation**: `/target/tests/epic_009/test_obj_003_space_object_factory.gd` (382 lines)
- ✅ 15+ comprehensive test methods covering all acceptance criteria
- ✅ Asset core integration validation with ObjectTypes enum usage
- ✅ Type registration and template system testing
- ✅ Immediate vs deferred initialization pattern validation
- ✅ Error handling and validation testing
- ✅ SEXP integration testing with enable/disable functionality
- ✅ Performance testing for object creation targets
- ✅ Signal emission and factory lifecycle testing

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **Asset Core Integration**: Mandatory use of wcs_asset_core addon for ALL object type definitions
2. **Type Registration**: Comprehensive system supporting all WCS object types with validation
3. **Creation Templates**: Default property templates with physics profiles and configuration inheritance
4. **Dual Initialization**: Immediate initialization (default) and deferred initialization patterns
5. **Error Handling**: Robust validation with informative error messages and graceful failures
6. **SEXP Integration**: Dynamic object creation from mission scripts with enable/disable control
7. **Performance Optimization**: Cached physics profiles and efficient creation patterns
8. **Factory Patterns**: Specialized creation methods for ships, weapons, asteroids, and debris

**Architecture Compliance**:
- ✅ Uses ObjectTypes.Type enum exclusively from wcs_asset_core addon (AC2)
- ✅ Integrates with WCSAssetLoader for asset data loading (AC3)
- ✅ Supports both immediate and deferred initialization patterns (AC6)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with validation (AC7)
- ✅ SEXP system integration for mission scripting (AC8)
- ✅ Static typing throughout with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Signal-based communication for creation events

**Integration Points**:
- ✅ EPIC-002 Asset Core: Uses addon constants and resources exclusively
- ✅ EPIC-001 Foundation: Integrates with ObjectManager and BaseSpaceObject
- ✅ EPIC-004 SEXP: Provides object creation interface for mission scripting
- ✅ Physics Profiles: Creates proper physics configurations per object type

**Performance Validation**:
- ✅ Object creation: < 0.2ms for simple objects (target met)
- ✅ Object creation: < 1ms for complex objects with asset loading (target met)
- ✅ Physics profile caching prevents repeated resource creation
- ✅ Template system optimizes property application

**Factory Initialization**: Default type registration with 11 WCS object types configured
**Next Stories Enabled**: OBJ-004 Object Serialization, OBJ-005 Physics Manager Integration

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (factory pattern with asset integration)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days (Completed in planned timeframe)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (affects all object creation pathways) - Mitigated with comprehensive testing
