- [x] **AC2**: Object query system supports "get objects in radius" and proximity detection efficiently
- [x] **AC3**: Collision optimization uses spatial partitioning to reduce unnecessary collision checks
- [x] **AC4**: Dynamic partitioning adapts grid size based on object density and distribution
- [x] **AC5**: Query caching system stores frequently requested spatial queries for performance
- [x] **AC6**: Performance monitoring tracks spatial query efficiency and optimization effectiveness

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Spatial partitioning from architecture.md lines 234-249, optimization systems
- **Godot Components**: Dictionary-based spatial hash, Vector3 calculations, performance monitoring
- **Performance Targets**: Spatial queries under 0.5ms for typical scenarios, partitioning under 0.1ms per object  
- **Integration Points**: ObjectManager spatial queries, collision detection optimization, LOD systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp` spatial optimization and object management systems
- **Godot Approach**: Custom spatial hash implementation with Godot's spatial optimization features
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing spatial partition granularity with query performance and memory usage
- **Success Metrics**: Fast spatial queries, reduced collision checks, scalable performance with object count
