# User Story: Subsystem and Animation Integration

## Story Definition
**As a**: Ship systems developer  
**I want**: Comprehensive subsystem and animation integration for complex space objects  
**So that**: Ships and large objects can display subsystem damage states, animations, and visual feedback matching WCS behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Subsystem management supports hierarchical subsystem organization for ships and capital vessels
- [ ] **AC2**: Animation integration enables turret rotation, engine glow, and moving parts animation
- [ ] **AC3**: Damage state visualization shows subsystem destruction and damage effects
- [ ] **AC4**: Animation controller coordinates multiple animation systems per object
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance optimization manages animation updates based on object LOD and distance
- [ ] **AC6**: Integration with effects system triggers appropriate visual feedback for subsystem states

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Subsystem integration from architecture.md lines 94-103, animation systems
- **Godot Components**: AnimationPlayer, Node hierarchy, subsystem damage visualization
- **Performance Targets**: Animation updates under 0.2ms per object, subsystem management under 0.1ms  
- **Integration Points**: BaseSpaceObject hierarchy, EPIC-008 effects system, model loading

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `model/modelinterp.cpp` subsystem management and animation systems
- **Godot Approach**: Node-based subsystem hierarchy with AnimationPlayer for complex animations
- **Key Challenges**: Managing complex subsystem hierarchies while maintaining performance
- **Success Metrics**: Smooth animations, accurate subsystem damage visualization, efficient updates

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-013 model loading system, BaseSpaceObject foundation
- **Blockers**: EPIC-008 effects system must be available for visual feedback
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-013 (Model Loading), integration with EPIC-008 effects
