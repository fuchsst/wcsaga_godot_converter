# User Story: Target Selection and Prioritization

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-009  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: AI combat system managing multiple threats  
**I want**: Intelligent target selection and threat prioritization algorithms  
**So that**: AI ships engage the most appropriate targets based on tactical situation, threat level, and mission objectives

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: Threat assessment system evaluates multiple factors (distance, weapon threat, size, health) to calculate target priority
- [x] **AC2**: Target selection algorithm chooses optimal targets based on ship role, current situation, and tactical doctrine
- [x] **AC3**: Dynamic target switching responds to changing battlefield conditions and new threat emergence
- [x] **AC4**: Mission-driven target prioritization respects mission objectives and special target designations
- [x] **AC5**: Formation coordination prevents multiple AI ships from targeting same low-priority targets inefficiently
- [x] **AC6**: Target acquisition behavior trees integrate with combat maneuvers and weapon systems

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Combat AI Behavior](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#combat-ai-behavior)
- **Godot Components**: Threat assessment system, target selection behavior tree nodes, tactical coordination
- **Integration Points**: Ship weapons systems, formation coordination, mission objectives from SEXP system

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aibig.cpp, /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (target selection logic)
- **Godot Approach**: Behavior tree condition and action nodes, threat assessment calculations, coordination signals
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing multiple threat factors, preventing target thrashing, coordination efficiency
- **Success Metrics**: AI chooses tactically appropriate targets 90%+ of the time, smooth target transitions

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-003: Basic Behavior Tree Infrastructure
  - AI-002: AI Manager and Ship Controller Framework
  - Object detection and tracking from ship systems
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-010 (combat maneuvers), AI-011 (evasive behaviors), AI-012 (weapon management)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [x] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [x] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [x] Integration testing completed successfully
- [x] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [x] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [x] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [x] Target selection works effectively in complex multi-target scenarios

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [x] **Task 1**: Create threat assessment system with multi-factor target evaluation
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement target selection behavior tree nodes (SelectTarget, SwitchTarget, ValidateTarget)
- [x] **Task 3**: Design tactical doctrine system for different ship roles and mission types
- [x] **Task 4**: Add formation-aware target coordination to prevent target overlap
- [x] **Task 5**: Integrate target selection with mission objectives and SEXP priority targets
- [x] **Task 6**: Implement dynamic target switching with hysteresis to prevent thrashing
- [x] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for threat assessment and target selection
- [x] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with multi-target combat scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Threat assessment calculation accuracy
  - Target selection algorithm decision making
  - Target switching logic and timing
  - Formation coordination for target assignment
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Target selection in complex multi-target environments
  - Mission objective integration with target priorities
  - Formation coordination preventing target conflicts
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - AI target selection in various combat scenarios
  - Target switching behavior during dynamic battles
  - Formation coordination effectiveness

## Notes and Comments
Target selection is the foundation of intelligent combat AI. The system must balance multiple competing priorities while avoiding the artificial or predictable patterns that reduce immersion in combat scenarios.
