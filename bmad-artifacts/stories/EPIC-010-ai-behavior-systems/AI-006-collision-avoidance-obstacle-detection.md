# User Story: Collision Avoidance and Obstacle Detection

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-006  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: AI ship navigation system  
**I want**: Sophisticated collision avoidance and obstacle detection capabilities  
**So that**: AI ships navigate safely around static and moving obstacles while maintaining realistic flight behavior and formation integrity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: AI ships detect and avoid static obstacles (asteroids, stations, debris) with appropriate safety margins
- [x] **AC2**: Dynamic collision avoidance prevents AI ships from colliding with other moving ships
- [x] **AC3**: Collision prediction algorithms calculate intercept paths and adjust course proactively  
- [x] **AC4**: Avoidance maneuvers maintain formation integrity when ships are in group formations
- [x] **AC5**: Emergency collision avoidance overrides other behaviors when immediate collision is detected
- [x] **AC6**: Performance optimization ensures collision detection scales efficiently with ship count

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Flight AI Systems](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#flight-ai-systems)
- **Godot Components**: Collision detection nodes, avoidance behavior tree nodes, spatial partitioning
- **Integration Points**: Physics system from EPIC-009, navigation system from AI-005, formation flying

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (collision avoidance), /source/code/physics/physics.cpp
- **Godot Approach**: Godot Area3D sensors, behavior tree avoidance nodes, spatial optimization
- **Key Challenges**: Predictive collision detection, maintaining formation during avoidance, performance
- **Success Metrics**: Zero AI ship collisions, smooth avoidance maneuvers, <1ms collision detection per ship

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-005: Waypoint Navigation and Path Planning
  - OBJ-009: Collision Detection (from EPIC-009)
  - AI-003: Basic Behavior Tree Infrastructure
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-007 (formation flying uses collision avoidance)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [x] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [x] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [x] Integration testing completed successfully
- [x] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [x] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)

- [x] Collision avoidance works reliably in complex multi-ship scenarios

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [x] **Task 1**: Create collision detection sensors using Godot Area3D and physics layers
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement collision prediction algorithms for moving object intercepts
- [x] **Task 3**: Design avoidance maneuver behavior tree nodes (AvoidObstacle, EmergencyAvoid)
- [x] **Task 4**: Add spatial partitioning optimization for efficient collision detection
- [x] **Task 5**: Integrate collision avoidance with navigation and formation systems
- [x] **Task 6**: Implement emergency collision avoidance with behavior priority override
- [x] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for collision detection and avoidance
- [x] **Task 8**: Create stress tests with many ships in confined spaces

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Collision detection accuracy and timing
  - Collision prediction algorithm correctness
  - Avoidance maneuver calculation
  - Spatial partitioning performance
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Collision avoidance with navigation system
  - Formation integrity during avoidance maneuvers
  - Emergency override of other behaviors
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - AI ships avoiding various obstacle types
  - Complex multi-ship collision scenarios
  - Performance with high ship density

## Notes and Comments
Collision avoidance is critical for maintaining the polished feel of WCS ship movement. The system must be predictive and smooth, avoiding the jerky or unrealistic movement patterns common in simpler AI systems.
