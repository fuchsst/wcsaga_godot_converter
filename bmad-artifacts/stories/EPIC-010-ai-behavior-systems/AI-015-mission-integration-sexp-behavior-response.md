## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aigoals.cpp, /source/code/mission/missionparse.cpp (mission AI integration)
- **Godot Approach**: Signal-based mission integration, SEXP function registration, dynamic behavior modification
- **Key Challenges**: Seamless SEXP integration, maintaining AI autonomy with mission control, performance
- **Success Metrics**: Mission AI behaviors feel natural and responsive, SEXP commands execute reliably

## Dependencies

- [x] Mission-driven AI behaviors work seamlessly with SEXP system

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [x] **Task 1**: Create SEXP AI interface with behavior control functions and goal management
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement mission event handlers for AI behavior triggers and modifications
- [x] **Task 3**: Design AI context awareness system for mission phase and objective adaptation
- [x] **Task 4**: Add dynamic AI goal assignment and priority modification system
- [x] **Task 5**: Create mission-specific behavior tree nodes and specialized AI patterns
- [x] **Task 6**: Implement AI mission reporting and status feedback system
- [x] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for SEXP integration and mission responsiveness
- [x] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with complex mission scenarios and SEXP commands

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - SEXP AI function execution and parameter handling
  - Mission event handling and AI response
  - Dynamic goal assignment and behavior modification
  - AI context awareness and adaptation logic
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - SEXP system integration with AI behaviors
  - Mission event system triggering AI responses
  - Complete mission scenarios with scripted AI behavior
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Mission AI behavior quality and narrative integration
  - SEXP command responsiveness and execution
  - AI behavior consistency during mission transitions

## Notes and Comments
Mission integration is critical for creating the narrative-driven AI behaviors that make WCS missions compelling. The system must provide mission designers with powerful tools while maintaining natural AI behavior.
