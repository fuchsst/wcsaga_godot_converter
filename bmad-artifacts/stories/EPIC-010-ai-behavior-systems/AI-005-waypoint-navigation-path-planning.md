# User Story: Waypoint Navigation and Path Planning

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-005  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: Player and AI system  
**I want**: Intelligent waypoint navigation and path planning for AI ships  
**So that**: AI ships can navigate efficiently to objectives while avoiding obstacles and threats with realistic flight patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: AI ships navigate accurately to single waypoints with smooth approach and arrival detection
- [x] **AC2**: Multi-waypoint path following maintains proper speed and heading transitions between waypoints  
- [x] **AC3**: Dynamic path planning avoids static obstacles (asteroids, structures) and moving threats
- [x] **AC4**: Path optimization chooses efficient routes considering fuel/time constraints and threat assessment
- [x] **AC5**: Integration with autopilot system allows player ships to use the same navigation algorithms
- [x] **AC6**: Navigation behavior trees handle complex scenarios like patrol routes and intercept courses

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Flight AI Systems](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#flight-ai-systems)
- **Godot Components**: Navigation behavior tree nodes, path planning algorithms, waypoint management
- **Integration Points**: Ship movement system, autopilot from WCS, obstacle detection, threat assessment

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/autopilot/autopilot.cpp, /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (navigation behaviors)
- **Godot Approach**: Custom behavior tree nodes for navigation, Godot's navigation system integration
- **Key Challenges**: Smooth path transitions, dynamic obstacle avoidance, performance with many ships
- **Success Metrics**: Ships reach waypoints within 50m accuracy, smooth movement without stuttering

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-001: LimboAI Integration and Setup
  - AI-002: AI Manager and Ship Controller Framework  
  - AI-003: Basic Behavior Tree Infrastructure
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-006 (collision avoidance), AI-007 (formation flying)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [x] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [x] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [x] Integration testing completed successfully
- [x] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [x] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [x] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [x] Navigation works smoothly with multiple AI ships simultaneously

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [x] **Task 1**: Create waypoint navigation behavior tree nodes (NavigateToWaypoint, FollowPath)
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement path planning algorithm with obstacle avoidance
- [x] **Task 3**: Add waypoint management system with arrival detection and path progression
- [x] **Task 4**: Create dynamic path recalculation for moving obstacles and threats
- [x] **Task 5**: Integrate navigation system with ship movement and autopilot controls
- [x] **Task 6**: Implement patrol route and intercept course navigation patterns
- [x] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for navigation algorithms
- [x] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with multiple ships navigating simultaneously

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Waypoint arrival detection accuracy
  - Path planning algorithm correctness
  - Path optimization and route selection
  - Dynamic path recalculation logic
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Navigation behavior tree execution
  - Multiple ships navigating without conflicts
  - Integration with ship movement systems
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Smooth navigation to various waypoint configurations
  - Obstacle avoidance during navigation
  - Performance with many ships navigating simultaneously

## Notes and Comments
This navigation system provides the foundation for all AI movement in WCS-Godot. It must replicate the smooth, intelligent navigation that makes WCS ship movement feel authentic while supporting the complex multi-ship scenarios.
