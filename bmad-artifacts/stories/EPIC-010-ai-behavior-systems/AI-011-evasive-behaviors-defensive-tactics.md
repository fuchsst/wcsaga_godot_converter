# User Story: Evasive Behaviors and Defensive Tactics

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-011  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: AI pilot under attack or in dangerous situations  
**I want**: Sophisticated evasive maneuvers and defensive tactics  
**So that**: AI ships survive longer in combat through intelligent defensive behaviors that create realistic and challenging combat scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: Evasive maneuvers respond appropriately to incoming threats (missiles, torpedoes, enemy fire)
- [x] **AC2**: Defensive tactics include energy management, shield positioning, and damage avoidance strategies
- [x] **AC3**: Threat-specific evasion patterns optimize for different weapon types and attack vectors
- [x] **AC4**: Emergency behaviors trigger appropriate responses to critical damage, system failures, or overwhelming odds
- [x] **AC5**: Defensive coordination with wingmen includes mutual support and coordinated defensive maneuvers
- [x] **AC6**: Retreat behaviors execute tactical withdrawals when appropriate based on damage, odds, or mission parameters

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Combat AI Behavior](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#combat-ai-behavior)
- **Godot Components**: Evasive maneuver behavior tree nodes, threat response systems, defensive coordination
- **Integration Points**: Threat detection, damage systems, shield/energy management, formation coordination

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (evasive behaviors), /source/code/ai/aibig.cpp (defensive tactics)
- **Godot Approach**: Behavior tree defensive nodes, threat response algorithms, coordination signals
- **Key Challenges**: Realistic evasion physics, appropriate threat response scaling, formation-aware defense
- **Success Metrics**: AI ships survive longer through effective evasion, defensive behaviors appear natural and tactical

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-009: Target Selection and Prioritization (threat detection)
  - AI-010: Combat Maneuvers and Attack Patterns
  - AI-006: Collision Avoidance and Obstacle Detection
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-012 (weapon management for defensive fire)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Evasive behaviors significantly improve AI survival rates in combat

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create evasive maneuver behavior tree nodes (EvadeMissile, CorkscewEvasion, JinkPattern)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement threat-specific evasion algorithms for different weapon types
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design defensive coordination system for wingman mutual support
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add emergency behavior triggers for critical damage and system failures
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create retreat behavior logic with tactical withdrawal calculations
- [ ] **Task 6**: Integrate defensive behaviors with energy and shield management systems
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for evasion algorithms and defensive coordination
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with various threat scenarios and damage conditions

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Evasive maneuver calculation accuracy
  - Threat-specific response logic
  - Emergency behavior trigger conditions
  - Defensive coordination algorithms
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Evasive behaviors with various weapon threats
  - Defensive coordination in formation scenarios
  - Emergency and retreat behaviors under combat stress
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Visual quality and realism of evasive maneuvers
  - AI survival improvement through defensive tactics
  - Coordination effectiveness in group defensive scenarios

## Notes and Comments
Defensive behaviors are crucial for creating challenging and realistic combat. AI ships that can effectively defend themselves create more engaging encounters and prevent combat from becoming one-sided.
