# User Story: Base Asset Data Structure and Interface

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-002  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer creating asset definitions for WCS content  
**I want**: A base asset data structure with common interface and validation capabilities  
**So that**: All asset types (ships, weapons, armor) share consistent properties and behavior while maintaining type safety

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: `BaseAssetData` Resource class created with all common asset properties (name, ID, description, file_path, asset_type, metadata)
- [ ] **AC2**: Asset validation interface implemented with `is_valid()` and `get_validation_errors()` methods
- [ ] **AC3**: Asset type enumeration system in place supporting all WCS asset categories
- [ ] **AC4**: Base class provides export properties for Godot inspector editing with proper groups and tooltips
- [ ] **AC5**: Static typing enforced throughout with comprehensive docstrings for all public methods
- [ ] **AC6**: Asset metadata system supports arbitrary key-value data for extensibility

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Asset Data Structure Hierarchy](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#asset-data-structure-hierarchy)
- **Godot Components**: Resource class, export properties, custom types, property groups
- **Integration Points**: Foundation for all specific asset types (ships, weapons, armor)

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Original WCS asset structures lack common interface - this is a Godot improvement
- **Godot Approach**: Use Godot Resource system with export properties for inspector integration
- **Key Challenges**: Designing flexible metadata system while maintaining type safety
- **Success Metrics**: Base class can be extended by specific asset types, validates correctly, appears properly in inspector

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001 (Plugin Framework) must be completed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: ASM-003 (Asset Types), ASM-005-007 (Specific asset implementations)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Base Resource class properly structured with export properties
- [ ] Validation system functional with proper error reporting
- [ ] Inspector integration works correctly with property groups
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples for inheritance
- [ ] Unit tests cover all base functionality

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `BaseAssetData` Resource class in `structures/base_asset_data.gd`
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement core asset properties with proper export annotations
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create asset validation interface with error collection
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement metadata system with Dictionary support
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add property groups and tooltips for inspector organization
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create comprehensive docstrings for all public methods
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write unit tests for base functionality

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Validation methods, property access, metadata operations
- **Integration Tests**: Inspector property display, inheritance by child classes
- **Manual Tests**: Create test asset in Godot inspector, verify property organization

## Notes and Comments
**INTERFACE FOUNDATION**: This story creates the fundamental interface that all asset types will inherit from. The design must be flexible enough to support diverse asset requirements while maintaining consistency.

**VALIDATION STRATEGY**: The validation system should be extensible to allow specific asset types to add their own validation rules while inheriting base validation.
