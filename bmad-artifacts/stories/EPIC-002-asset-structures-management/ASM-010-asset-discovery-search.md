# User Story: Asset Discovery and Search Implementation

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-010  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer or content creator working with large WCS asset collections  
**I want**: Advanced asset discovery and search capabilities with filtering, sorting, and relationship browsing  
**So that**: Assets can be quickly found and explored using flexible search criteria and visual relationship mapping

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Asset search API supporting text queries, type filters, and property-based searches
- [ ] **AC2**: Advanced filtering by asset type, tags, metadata, and custom properties with combination filters
- [ ] **AC3**: Search result ranking and sorting by relevance, name, type, modification date, and usage frequency
- [ ] **AC4**: Asset relationship browsing showing dependencies, references, and usage patterns
- [ ] **AC5**: Search performance optimized for large asset collections with indexed searching (<50ms for typical queries)
- [ ] **AC6**: Search history and saved search patterns for frequently used queries

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Asset Discovery and Search](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#asset-loading-architecture)
- **Godot Components**: Search algorithms, indexing systems, filtering logic, result ranking
- **Integration Points**: RegistryManager for asset data, ValidationManager for quality filtering, Editor UI for search interface

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Asset browsing patterns and search needs from WCS content management
- **Godot Approach**: Build efficient search index with multiple access patterns and ranking algorithms
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining search performance with large asset collections, relevant result ranking
- **Success Metrics**: Fast search response times, accurate result ranking, comprehensive filtering options

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001-009 (Framework through Validation) completed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: ASM-011 (Integration) will use search functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Search performance benchmarks met for large collections
- [ ] Filtering and sorting systems comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Asset relationship browsing functional and informative
- [ ] Documentation includes search API and usage examples
- [ ] Unit tests cover all search scenarios and performance cases

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Extend RegistryManager with advanced search capabilities
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement text search with fuzzy matching and relevance ranking
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create comprehensive filtering system for asset properties
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build asset relationship browsing and dependency visualization
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add search result sorting and ranking algorithms
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement search history and saved pattern functionality
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create performance benchmarks and optimization for large datasets

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Search algorithms, filtering logic, ranking systems
- **Performance Tests**: Search speed benchmarks with large asset collections
- **Integration Tests**: Registry integration, validation filtering, relationship browsing
- **Manual Tests**: Search real WCS assets, verify result quality and performance

## Notes and Comments
**SEARCH QUALITY**: Search results should be intuitive and relevant to content creators, not just technically accurate matches.

**PERFORMANCE SCALING**: Search performance must remain responsive even with thousands of assets, requiring efficient indexing strategies.

**RELATIONSHIP EXPLORATION**: Asset relationship browsing helps content creators understand asset dependencies and usage patterns.
