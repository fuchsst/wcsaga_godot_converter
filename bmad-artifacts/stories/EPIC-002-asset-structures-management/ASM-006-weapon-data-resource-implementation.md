# User Story: Weapon Data Resource Implementation

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-006  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Content creator defining weapon specifications for WCS conversion  
**I want**: A complete WeaponData Resource class supporting all WCS weapon types and behavior flags  
**So that**: Weapons can be configured in Godot inspector with full ballistic, energy, missile, and beam weapon capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: `WeaponData` Resource class extends BaseAssetData with all weapon_info fields from WCS
- [ ] **AC2**: All weapon types supported: ballistic, energy, missile, beam with type-specific properties
- [ ] **AC3**: Complete flag system implemented: 31 primary weapon flags (WIF_*) and 24 advanced flags (WIF2_*)
- [ ] **AC4**: Complex homing systems: heat-seeking, aspect-lock, Javelin-style targeting with proper parameters
- [ ] **AC5**: Projectile and effect definitions integrated with Godot's particle/effect systems
- [ ] **AC6**: Weapon validation ensures type consistency and required field completion

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Weapon Asset Extension](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#asset-data-structure-hierarchy)
- **Godot Components**: Resource class, export properties, enumeration types, sub-resources for effects
- **Integration Points**: ShipData weapon mounts, projectile systems, particle effects, sound systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `weapon/weapon.h` weapon_info structure, weapon flags, homing systems, effect definitions
- **Godot Approach**: Use enums for weapon types and flags, sub-resources for effect definitions
- **Key Challenges**: Mapping complex WCS weapon behavior flags to Godot-friendly properties
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS weapon types functional, flag system comprehensive, validation robust

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001-004 (Framework, Base, Types, Loader) completed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: ASM-005 (ShipData), ASM-007 (ArmorData), ASM-011 (Integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] All WCS weapon properties mapped with proper types
- [ ] Weapon flag system complete and validated
- [ ] Inspector integration provides clear weapon configuration
- [ ] Documentation includes weapon type and flag reference
- [ ] Unit tests cover all weapon types and validation scenarios

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `WeaponData` Resource class in `structures/weapon_data.gd`
- [ ] **Task 2**: Map all weapon_info fields with proper export properties
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement weapon type enums (ballistic, energy, missile, beam)
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create complete weapon flag system (WIF_* and WIF2_* flags)
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement homing system parameters and targeting types
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add weapon-specific validation rules and error checking
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create test weapons for all types and validate functionality

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Weapon validation, flag operations, type checking
- **Integration Tests**: Weapon loading, ship mounting compatibility
- **Manual Tests**: Create various weapon types in inspector, verify all properties
- **Validation Tests**: Load original WCS weapons and verify flag/property preservation

## Notes and Comments
**WEAPON COMPLEXITY**: WCS weapons have sophisticated behavior flags (55+ total) and complex homing systems. All functionality must be preserved for authentic gameplay.

**FLAG SYSTEM**: The WIF_* and WIF2_* flag systems control weapon behavior in detail. Each flag must be mapped and documented for content creators.

**HOMING SYSTEMS**: Different missile types (heat-seeking, aspect-lock, Javelin) have unique targeting and guidance parameters that must be faithfully represented.
