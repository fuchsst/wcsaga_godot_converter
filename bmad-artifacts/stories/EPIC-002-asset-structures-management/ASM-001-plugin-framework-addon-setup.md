# User Story: Plugin Framework and Addon Setup

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-001  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working on the WCS-Godot conversion project  
**I want**: A properly configured Godot addon with plugin framework and autoload integration  
**So that**: The asset management system can be shared between the main game and FRED2 editor as a reusable component

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Addon directory structure created at `addons/wcs_asset_core/` with all required folders
- [ ] **AC2**: `plugin.cfg` file properly configured with addon metadata, dependencies, and autoload definitions
- [ ] **AC3**: `AssetCorePlugin.gd` main plugin class implemented with proper initialization and cleanup
- [ ] **AC4**: Custom asset types registered in Godot editor (BaseAssetData, ShipData, WeaponData, ArmorData)
- [ ] **AC5**: Plugin activates/deactivates cleanly without errors and integrates with project settings
- [ ] **AC6**: Asset system autoloads are properly configured and accessible throughout the project

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Plugin Integration Architecture](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#plugin-integration-architecture)
- **Godot Components**: EditorPlugin, autoloads, custom Resource types, project settings
- **Integration Points**: Main game asset access, FRED2 editor integration, project-wide availability

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: N/A - This is a Godot addon infrastructure story
- **Godot Approach**: Follow Godot addon best practices with proper plugin lifecycle management
- **Key Challenges**: Ensuring clean plugin activation/deactivation and proper autoload registration
- **Success Metrics**: Plugin appears in Project Settings, can be enabled/disabled cleanly, autoloads are accessible

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-001 Core Foundation completed and validated
- **Blockers**: None - this is foundational infrastructure
- **Related Stories**: All other ASM stories depend on this framework

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Plugin loads and unloads cleanly without errors or warnings
- [ ] All custom types appear correctly in Godot editor
- [ ] Autoloads are accessible and functional
- [ ] Documentation includes setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Plugin structure validated against Godot addon standards

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create addon directory structure (`addons/wcs_asset_core/`)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement `plugin.cfg` with proper metadata and autoload configuration
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create `AssetCorePlugin.gd` main plugin class with lifecycle methods
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement custom type registration for asset Resource classes
- [ ] **Task 5**: Set up autoload registration and cleanup
- [ ] **Task 6**: Test plugin activation/deactivation in Godot editor
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create basic documentation and README for the addon

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Plugin class initialization and cleanup methods
- **Integration Tests**: Plugin activation/deactivation, autoload accessibility
- **Manual Tests**: Enable/disable plugin in Project Settings, verify custom types appear

## Notes and Comments
**FOUNDATION STORY**: This story establishes the fundamental addon infrastructure that all other asset management functionality will build upon. Must be rock-solid before proceeding with asset structure implementation.

**CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES**: This story enables all subsequent EPIC-002 development by providing the shared addon framework.
