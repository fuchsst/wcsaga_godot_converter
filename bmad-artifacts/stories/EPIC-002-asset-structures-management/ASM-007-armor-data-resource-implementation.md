# User Story: Armor Data Resource Implementation

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-007  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Content creator defining armor and shield specifications for WCS conversion  
**I want**: A comprehensive ArmorData Resource class with shield, hull, and subsystem armor definitions  
**So that**: Ship defensive systems can be configured with accurate damage resistance and shield behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: `ArmorData` Resource class extends BaseAssetData with all armor and shield specification fields
- [ ] **AC2**: Shield system properties: strength, regeneration rate, recharge delay, collapse behavior
- [ ] **AC3**: Hull armor definitions with damage type resistances and structural integrity values
- [ ] **AC4**: Subsystem armor specifications for engines, weapons, sensors with independent damage tracking
- [ ] **AC5**: Damage type system supporting all WCS damage categories (laser, ballistic, missile, beam, etc.)
- [ ] **AC6**: Armor validation ensures consistent damage resistances and realistic defensive values

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Asset Data Structure Hierarchy](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#asset-data-structure-hierarchy)
- **Godot Components**: Resource class, export properties, damage type enums, sub-resources
- **Integration Points**: ShipData defensive systems, damage calculation systems, combat mechanics

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Shield and armor systems from ship definitions, damage type calculations
- **Godot Approach**: Use sub-resources for different armor types, enums for damage categories
- **Key Challenges**: Mapping WCS damage type system to structured Godot properties
- **Success Metrics**: All defensive systems properly configured, damage calculations accurate

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001-004 (Framework, Base, Types, Loader) completed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: ASM-005 (ShipData), ASM-006 (WeaponData), ASM-011 (Integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] All armor and shield properties mapped accurately
- [ ] Damage type system complete and validated
- [ ] Inspector integration provides clear defensive system configuration
- [ ] Documentation includes armor type and resistance reference
- [ ] Unit tests cover armor calculations and validation

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `ArmorData` Resource class in `structures/armor_data.gd`
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement shield system properties and behavior parameters
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create hull armor definitions with damage type resistances
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add subsystem armor specifications for independent tracking
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement damage type enumeration and resistance system
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add armor-specific validation rules and consistency checks
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create test armor configurations and validate defensive calculations

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Armor validation, damage calculations, resistance values
- **Integration Tests**: Ship armor integration, damage system compatibility
- **Manual Tests**: Configure various armor types in inspector, verify properties
- **Validation Tests**: Compare defensive calculations with original WCS behavior

## Notes and Comments
**DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS**: Armor and shields are critical for authentic WCS combat feel. All damage resistances and shield behaviors must be faithfully preserved.

**DAMAGE TYPE MAPPING**: WCS has specific damage type categories that affect armor effectiveness. This system must be accurately represented.

**SUBSYSTEM ARMOR**: Individual ship subsystems (engines, weapons) can have different armor values, requiring careful component tracking.
