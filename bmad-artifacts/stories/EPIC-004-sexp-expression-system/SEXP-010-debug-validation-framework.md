## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test validation rules, error reporting, debugging functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Test with FRED2 editor, complex expression debugging, visual representation
- **User Experience Tests**: Validate debugging workflow with real mission design scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure debugging tools don't impact runtime performance significantly

## Notes and Comments
**DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE CRITICAL**: This story significantly impacts mission designer productivity. The debugging tools must be intuitive and provide actionable feedback.

Visual representation of complex SEXP expressions is crucial for debugging. Focus on clear, hierarchical displays that make nested logic easy to understand.

Error messages should not just identify problems but suggest specific fixes. Consider integrating AI-powered suggestions for common SEXP errors.

The debugging framework should be lightweight enough to not impact runtime performance while providing comprehensive information for development.
