- **Key Challenges**: Context management across evaluations, cache invalidation, performance optimization
- **Success Metrics**: <1ms evaluation for typical expressions, efficient cache hit rates, robust error recovery

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: SEXP-001 (parser), SEXP-002 (expression trees), EPIC-001 foundation systems
- **Blockers**: None - builds on parser and expression foundation
- **Related Stories**: Required by all function implementations and mission integration stories

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [x] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [x] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive evaluation scenarios
- [x] Performance benchmarks meet <1ms evaluation requirement

- [x] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [x] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [x] Cache performance metrics and monitoring functional

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 4-5 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] **Task 1**: Implement SexpEvaluator singleton with core evaluation methods
- [x] **Task 2**: Create EvaluationContext class with variable and object reference management
- [x] **Task 3**: Implement expression caching system with LRU cache and performance tracking
- [x] **Task 4**: Add context-sensitive evaluation with performance optimization hints
- [x] **Task 5**: Integrate pre-validation system with enhanced tokenizer
- [x] **Task 6**: Implement comprehensive error handling with execution context tracking
- [x] **Task 7**: Add performance monitoring and statistical tracking for optimization
- [x] **Task 8**: Write extensive unit tests covering all evaluation scenarios and edge cases

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test all evaluation types, context management, error conditions, cache behavior
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark evaluation speed, cache hit rates, memory usage patterns
- **Integration Tests**: Complex nested expressions, variable state management, error recovery
- **Stress Tests**: High-volume evaluation scenarios, cache performance under load

## Notes and Comments
**PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: This story implements the core evaluation engine that will be called thousands of times per frame in complex missions. Performance optimization is critical from the start.

The caching system must intelligently handle expression and context dependencies to ensure correct results while maximizing performance. Focus on cache invalidation strategies and hit rate optimization.

Error handling must preserve execution context for debugging while maintaining performance. Stack traces and context information are essential for mission designers.
