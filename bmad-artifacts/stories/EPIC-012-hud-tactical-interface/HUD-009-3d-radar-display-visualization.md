## Godot Implementation Strategy

### 3D Visualization
- **3D-to-2D Projection**: Accurate transformation from 3D world space to 2D radar display
- **Spherical Coordinates**: Use spherical coordinate system for natural 3D radar representation
- **Perspective Handling**: Maintain spatial relationships while providing clear 2D visualization
- **Elevation Indicators**: Visual cues for objects above or below player's horizontal plane

### Performance Optimization
- **Object Culling**: Only render objects within current radar range and zoom level
- **Update Batching**: Batch radar updates to minimize performance impact
- **LOD System**: Reduce detail for distant objects or when displaying many contacts
- **Efficient Rendering**: Use Godot's 2D rendering optimizations for smooth display

### Visual Design
- **Clear Object Identification**: Distinct icons and colors for immediate recognition
- **Spatial Clarity**: Visual design that maintains 3D spatial understanding
- **Scale Consistency**: Proportional representation maintaining tactical accuracy
- **Clean Interface**: Uncluttered display that provides maximum information density
