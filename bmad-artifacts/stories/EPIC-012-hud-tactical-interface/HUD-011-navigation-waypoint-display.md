## Godot Implementation Strategy

### 3D Navigation Visualization
- **World Space Markers**: Use 3D nodes for waypoint markers that maintain proper spatial relationships
- **HUD Overlay**: 2D HUD elements for navigation information that doesn't obstruct 3D view
- **Distance Calculation**: Efficient 3D distance and bearing calculations for real-time updates
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear visual distinction between navigation elements and combat information

### Mission Integration
- **SEXP Integration**: Connect with mission scripting system for automated waypoint management
- **Dynamic Updates**: Responsive waypoint updates based on mission progression and events
- **Objective Tracking**: Link navigation waypoints to mission objectives for contextual guidance
- **State Persistence**: Maintain waypoint state across mission events and save/load cycles

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Updates**: Batch navigation calculations to minimize per-frame performance impact
- **Culling System**: Hide or simplify waypoints outside relevant range or view
- **LOD Management**: Reduce detail for distant waypoints or when displaying many points
- **Smart Refresh**: Update navigation data only when necessary to maintain performance
