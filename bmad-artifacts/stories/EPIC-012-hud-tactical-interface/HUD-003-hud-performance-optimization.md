# HUD-003: HUD Performance Optimization

## Story Information
**Epic**: EPIC-012 HUD & Tactical Interface  
**Story ID**: HUD-003  
**Story Name**: HUD Performance Optimization  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Ready  
**Estimate**: 2 Story Points  
**Assignee**: Dev (GDScript Developer)  
**Created**: 2025-06-09  
**Sprint**: EPIC-012 Phase 1  

## Story Description
As a **pilot in the WCS-Godot conversion**, I need **HUD systems that maintain 60 FPS performance during intensive combat scenarios** so that **the tactical interface remains responsive and doesn't impact flight and combat performance, even with complex multi-element displays**.

This story implements comprehensive performance optimization for the HUD system, including frame budget management, element culling, LOD systems, and automatic optimization to ensure the HUD never becomes a performance bottleneck.

## WCS Reference Analysis

### Original C++ Systems
- **`hud/hudupdate.cpp`**: HUD update optimization and selective rendering
- **`hud/hudperformance.cpp`**: Performance monitoring and frame budget management
- **`graphics/2d.cpp`**: 2D rendering optimization for HUD elements
- **`render/2d.cpp`**: Optimized 2D drawing with batching and culling

### Key C++ Features Analyzed
1. **Frame Budget Management**: Strict 2ms budget for HUD rendering per frame
2. **Selective Updates**: Only update HUD elements when underlying data changes
3. **Distance-based LOD**: Reduce complexity for elements not critical to current situation
4. **Render Batching**: Group similar HUD elements for efficient rendering
5. **Culling Systems**: Skip rendering for off-screen or occluded elements

### WCS Performance Characteristics
- **Target Performance**: 60 FPS sustained with full HUD active
- **Frame Budget**: <2ms total HUD time per frame (3.3% of 16.67ms frame)
- **Element Budget**: <0.1ms per individual HUD element
- **Memory Limit**: <50MB total HUD system memory usage
- **Optimization**: Automatic performance scaling under load
