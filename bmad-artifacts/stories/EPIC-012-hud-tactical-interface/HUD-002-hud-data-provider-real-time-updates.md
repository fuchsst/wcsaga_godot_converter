## Story Information
**Epic**: EPIC-012 HUD & Tactical Interface  
**Story ID**: HUD-002  
**Story Name**: HUD Data Provider System and Real-time Updates  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Ready  
**Estimate**: 3 Story Points  
**Assignee**: Dev (GDScript Developer)  
**Created**: 2025-06-09  
**Sprint**: EPIC-012 Phase 1  

## Story Description
As a **pilot in the WCS-Godot conversion**, I need a **comprehensive data provider system that delivers real-time ship and game information to HUD elements** so that **I can view accurate, up-to-date flight and combat data with optimized performance and minimal system impact**.

This story establishes the data layer that feeds all HUD elements with real-time information from ship systems, targeting data, mission status, and game state while maintaining high performance through intelligent caching and update optimization.

## WCS Reference Analysis

### Original C++ Systems
- **`hud/hudupdate.cpp`**: Real-time HUD data updates and refresh systems
- **`hud/hudparse.cpp`**: Data parsing and formatting for HUD display
- **`ship/ship.cpp`**: Ship status queries and real-time ship data access
- **`object/object.cpp`**: Object tracking and status for radar/targeting systems
- **`mission/missionparse.cpp`**: Mission state and objective data

### Key C++ Features Analyzed
1. **Real-time Data Access**: Direct access to ship structures and game objects for immediate updates
2. **Data Optimization**: Cached queries and intelligent update frequencies for performance
3. **Multi-source Integration**: Combines data from ships, objects, missions, and game state
4. **Update Prioritization**: Critical data (targeting) updates faster than secondary data
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when data sources are unavailable

### WCS Data Characteristics
- **Ship Status**: Hull, shields, energy levels, subsystem status updated at 60 FPS
- **Targeting Data**: Target information, distance, lock status updated at 60 FPS
- **Weapon Status**: Ammo, energy, linking status updated at 30 FPS

- **EPIC-001 Core Foundation**: Leverage `ObjectManager` for object enumeration and tracking
- **EPIC-004 SEXP**: Future integration for mission-driven data queries

### Performance Considerations
- **Update Scheduling**: Timer-based updates for non-critical data, immediate updates for critical data
- **Memory Management**: Efficient caching with automatic cleanup and size limits
- **Signal Optimization**: Type-specific signals to minimize unnecessary processing
- **Batch Processing**: Group related data queries to minimize system calls

### Data Source Priority
1. **Critical (60 FPS)**: Ship status, targeting data, immediate flight information
2. **Important (30 FPS)**: Weapon status, energy levels, combat-related data
3. **Periodic (15 FPS)**: Radar contacts, object tracking, spatial data
4. **Slow (2 FPS)**: Mission info, objectives, system diagnostics
