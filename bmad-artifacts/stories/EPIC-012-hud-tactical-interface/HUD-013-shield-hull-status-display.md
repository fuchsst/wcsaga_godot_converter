## Story Description
As a **pilot in the WCS-Godot conversion**, I need **comprehensive shield and hull status displays** so that **I can monitor my ship's defensive integrity, understand damage patterns and critical vulnerabilities, manage shield distribution and regeneration, and make informed tactical decisions based on my ship's current defensive capability**.

This story implements the ship defensive status system that provides pilots with real-time information about hull integrity, shield strength, damage distribution, and defensive system status for effective damage management and survival tactics.
