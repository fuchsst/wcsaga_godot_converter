# STORY-FLOW-013: Resolve Scene Lifecycle Violations in Game Flow Systems

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: FLOW-013
**Epic**: EPIC-007: Overall Game Flow & State Management
**User Story**: As a developer, I want to refactor game flow systems, particularly `GameStateManager` and related scene transition logic, to correctly manage scene and node lifecycles, so that the game is stable, free of memory leaks, and behaves predictably during state changes.
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimate**: 3-4 days
**Status**: READY
**Created**: 2025-06-07
**Updated**: 2025-06-07
**Depends On**: Stable EPIC-001.
**Blocks**: Further development on game flow and state-dependent systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  All scenes managed by `GameStateManager` and `SceneManager` (if used for transitions) are instantiated and added to the scene tree correctly.
2.  Nodes are consistently removed from the scene tree using `queue_free()` when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
3.  References to nodes that might be freed are validated (e.g., using `is_instance_valid(node)`) before access, especially in deferred calls or signal connections.
4.  The usage of `_ready()`, `_enter_tree()`, `_exit_tree()`, and `_process()` / `_physics_process()` in game flow related scenes and scripts aligns with Godot's intended node lifecycle.
5.  No "dangling pointer" errors or crashes related to node lifecycle occur during extensive game state transitions (e.g., main menu -> game -> main menu -> options -> game).
6.  Memory usage remains stable after repeated scene loading and unloading cycles.

## Technical Requirements
1.  Audit all scripts involved in game state transitions and scene management within EPIC-007's scope.
2.  Identify and correct any improper node instantiation, freeing, or referencing patterns.
3.  Ensure signal connections are managed correctly (disconnect when objects are freed if necessary).
4.  Refactor logic to avoid accessing nodes that might have been `queue_free()`d in the same frame or a previous frame without validation.

## Implementation Details
-   Review `GameStateManager.gd`, `StateTransitionManager.gd` (if it exists as per EPIC-007 architecture), and any scenes directly loaded/unloaded by these managers.
-   Pay close attention to how current scenes are replaced or removed when transitioning to a new state.
-   If a `SceneManager` addon is used, ensure its API is used correctly for scene loading/unloading.
-   Use Godot's debugger and profiler (monitor tab) to check for memory leaks or orphaned nodes.

## Test Cases
1.  **TC-FLOW013-01**: Navigate through all major game states (e.g., Startup -> MainMenu -> PilotSelection -> CampaignSelection -> MissionBriefing -> MissionLoading -> InMission (mock) -> MissionDebriefing -> MainMenu) multiple times. Verify no errors or crashes.
2.  **TC-FLOW013-02**: Monitor memory usage while repeatedly loading and unloading a specific game scene (e.g., Main Menu). Verify memory does not continuously increase.
3.  **TC-FLOW013-03**: Test rapid state transitions. Verify system stability.
4.  **TC-FLOW013-04**: Introduce a simulated error during a scene load (if possible) and verify graceful recovery or clear error reporting without crashing due to lifecycle issues.

## WCS Reference
-   Original WCS stability during screen transitions and game state changes.

## Godot Implementation Approach
-   Strict adherence to Godot's node lifecycle documentation.
-   Use `Node.is_queued_for_deletion()` or `is_instance_valid()` for checks.
-   Prefer `queue_free()` over `free()` for nodes.
-   Ensure signals are disconnected from objects that are about to be freed if the signal source might outlive the target, or if the target method relies on instance validity.

## Definition of Done
-   Code related to scene lifecycle management in game flow systems reviewed and refactored.
-   All acceptance criteria met.
-   No lifecycle-related errors observed during testing.
-   Memory profiling shows stable memory usage.
-   Story validated by QA.

## Notes
-   This story directly addresses one of the critical issues identified in the QA review of EPIC-007.
