**Phase**: 1 - Core State Management  
**Story ID**: FLOW-001

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: Critical

## User Story

**As a** game system developer  
**I want** a robust central game state manager with validated state transitions  
**So that** all game systems can coordinate properly and transitions are smooth and error-free  

## Story Description

Enhance the existing `GameStateManager` autoload singleton (`target/autoload/game_state_manager.gd`) to support additional game flow states required for comprehensive mission and campaign management. The existing GameStateManager already provides MAIN_MENU, BRIEFING, MISSION, DEBRIEF, OPTIONS, CAMPAIGN_MENU, LOADING, FRED_EDITOR, and SHUTDOWN states. This story adds the remaining states needed for complete game flow coverage while preserving all existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Enhanced State Machine**: Extend existing GameStateManager with additional game flow states
  - [ ] Add PILOT_SELECTION, SHIP_SELECTION, MISSION_COMPLETE, CAMPAIGN_COMPLETE to existing GameState enum
  - [ ] Add STATISTICS_REVIEW, SAVE_GAME_MENU states for UI flow
  - [ ] Preserve all existing states (MAIN_MENU, BRIEFING, MISSION, DEBRIEF, OPTIONS, CAMPAIGN_MENU, LOADING, FRED_EDITOR, SHUTDOWN)
  - [ ] Extend existing state transition validation with new state rules

- [ ] **State Transition System**: Validated state transition with error handling
  - [ ] `transition_to_state()` method with validation and data passing
  - [ ] Invalid transition detection and error reporting
  - [ ] State transition rollback capability on failure
  - [ ] Transition performance under 16ms for all state changes

- [ ] **Signal-Based Communication**: Leverage existing signal system
  - [ ] Use existing `state_changed(old_state: GameState, new_state: GameState)` signal
  - [ ] Use existing `state_transition_started(target_state: GameState)` signal
  - [ ] Use existing `state_transition_completed(final_state: GameState)` signal
  - [ ] Add error handling signals for new state transition failures

- [ ] **Error Handling and Recovery**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation
  - [ ] Comprehensive error logging with detailed context
  - [ ] Fallback to safe states (MAIN_MENU) on critical failures
  - [ ] State validation before and after transitions
  - [ ] Recovery from corrupted state conditions

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Reference
- **Architecture Document**: `EPIC-007-overall-game-flow-state-management/architecture.md` (lines 65-134)
- **WCS Analysis**: `gamesequence/gamesequence.cpp` - Central state machine with 54 states
- **Existing Resource**: `target/autoload/game_state_manager.gd` (already comprehensive with signals, state management, scene handling)
- **Integration**: Add new states to existing GameState enum and extend transition validation

### Implementation Specifications

#### Extending Existing GameStateManager
```gdscript
# Extend existing GameStateManager enum in target/autoload/game_state_manager.gd
# EXISTING STATES (already implemented):
enum GameState {
    MAIN_MENU,        # Main menu and navigation (EXISTING)
    BRIEFING,         # Pre-mission briefing (EXISTING)
    MISSION,          # Active mission gameplay (EXISTING)
    DEBRIEF,          # Post-mission debriefing (EXISTING)
    OPTIONS,          # Settings and configuration (EXISTING)
    CAMPAIGN_MENU,    # Campaign browsing (EXISTING)
    LOADING,          # Mission initialization (EXISTING)
    FRED_EDITOR,      # Mission editor (EXISTING)
    SHUTDOWN,         # Game exit and cleanup (EXISTING)
    
    # NEW STATES TO ADD for EPIC-007:
    PILOT_SELECTION,  # Pilot management (NEW)
    SHIP_SELECTION,   # Ship and loadout selection (NEW)
    MISSION_COMPLETE, # Mission completion processing (NEW)
    CAMPAIGN_COMPLETE,# Campaign completion (NEW)
    STATISTICS_REVIEW,# Statistics and achievements review (NEW)
    SAVE_GAME_MENU    # Save/load interface (NEW)
}

# The existing GameStateManager already provides:
# - signal state_changed(old_state: GameState, new_state: GameState)
# - signal state_transition_started(target_state: GameState)
# - signal state_transition_completed(final_state: GameState)
# - var current_state: GameState
# - var previous_state: GameState
# - var state_stack: Array[GameState]
# - Scene management and transition handling
```

#### Enhanced State Transition Validation
```gdscript
# Add to existing GameStateManager._is_valid_transition() method
# Extend existing validation with new state transitions

func _is_valid_transition(from_state: GameState, to_state: GameState) -> bool:
    # Existing transitions already handled by GameStateManager
    # Add new transition rules for EPIC-007 states
    
    var additional_transitions = {
        GameState.STARTUP: [GameState.MAIN_MENU],
        GameState.MAIN_MENU: [GameState.PILOT_SELECTION, GameState.OPTIONS, GameState.SHUTDOWN],
        GameState.PILOT_SELECTION: [GameState.MAIN_MENU, GameState.CAMPAIGN_SELECTION],
        GameState.CAMPAIGN_SELECTION: [GameState.PILOT_SELECTION, GameState.MISSION_BRIEFING],
        GameState.MISSION_BRIEFING: [GameState.CAMPAIGN_SELECTION, GameState.SHIP_SELECTION],
        GameState.SHIP_SELECTION: [GameState.MISSION_BRIEFING, GameState.MISSION_LOADING],
        GameState.MISSION_LOADING: [GameState.IN_MISSION, GameState.MAIN_MENU],
        GameState.IN_MISSION: [GameState.MISSION_PAUSED, GameState.MISSION_COMPLETE, GameState.MAIN_MENU],
        GameState.MISSION_PAUSED: [GameState.IN_MISSION, GameState.MAIN_MENU],
        GameState.MISSION_COMPLETE: [GameState.MISSION_DEBRIEFING],
        GameState.MISSION_DEBRIEFING: [GameState.CAMPAIGN_SELECTION, GameState.CAMPAIGN_COMPLETE],
        GameState.CAMPAIGN_COMPLETE: [GameState.MAIN_MENU],
        GameState.OPTIONS: [previous_state],  # Return to previous state
        GameState.SHUTDOWN: []  # No transitions from shutdown
    }
    
    return to_state in valid_transitions.get(from_state, [])
```

### File Structure

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- State transitions must complete in under 16ms to maintain 60 FPS
- Use deferred calls for resource-intensive operations during transitions
- Implement state change batching for multiple rapid transitions
- Profile state transition performance and optimize bottlenecks

### Error Recovery Strategy
- Always maintain a valid current state
- Implement rollback mechanism for failed transitions
- Provide clear error messages with actionable recovery steps
- Log all state changes and errors for debugging

### Integration Points
- **EPIC-006**: Menu & Navigation System (state-driven scene loading)
- **EPIC-002**: Asset Structures (resource coordination during states)
- **All Game Systems**: State-aware initialization and cleanup

## Dependencies

### Prerequisite Stories
- **EPIC-001**: Core Foundation & Infrastructure must be complete
- **EPIC-001-CF-001**: System globals and types
- **EPIC-001-CF-003**: Debug error management

### Dependent Stories
- **FLOW-002**: State Transition System and Validation (extends this foundation)
- **FLOW-003**: Session Management and Lifecycle (depends on state management)
- **All other EPIC-007 stories**: Build upon this core state management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```gdscript
# test_game_state_manager.gd
func test_valid_state_transitions():
    # Test all valid state transitions
    
func test_invalid_state_transitions():
    # Test rejection of invalid transitions
    
func test_state_history_tracking():
    # Verify state history is maintained correctly
    
func test_signal_emissions():
    # Verify signals are emitted with correct parameters
    
func test_error_recovery():
    # Test rollback and error handling
```

### Integration Tests
- State transition coordination with scene loading
- Performance testing under load
- Memory usage during extended state cycling
- Signal propagation to multiple listening systems
