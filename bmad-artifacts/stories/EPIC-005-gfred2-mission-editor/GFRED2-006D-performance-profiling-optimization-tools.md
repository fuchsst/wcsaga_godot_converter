# User Story: Performance Profiling and Optimization Tools

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-006D  
**Created**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: Ready  
**Updated**: May 31, 2025  
**Priority**: Medium (Phase 3 Implementation Ready)

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer creating complex missions with performance considerations  
**I want**: Integrated performance profiling and optimization tools within the mission editor  
**So that**: I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks before missions reach players

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Mission performance profiler analyzes rendering, physics, and script performance
- [ ] **AC2**: SEXP performance analysis identifies slow expressions and optimization opportunities
- [ ] **AC3**: Asset performance tracking shows polygon counts, texture usage, and memory impact
- [ ] **AC4**: Real-time performance monitoring during mission editing and testing
- [ ] **AC5**: Optimization suggestions provide actionable recommendations for performance improvements
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance budget system warns when missions exceed target thresholds
- [ ] **AC7**: Performance comparison tools track optimization progress over time
- [ ] **AC8**: Export performance report for mission optimization documentation

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md` Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**
- **ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE**: ALL performance UI components MUST be centralized scenes in `addons/gfred2/scenes/` structure
- **Core Integration**: Leverage EPIC-001 performance monitoring and optimization utilities
- **SEXP Profiling**: Use EPIC-004 performance monitoring for SEXP expression analysis
- **Asset Analysis**: Integrate with EPIC-002 asset system for resource usage tracking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Non-intrusive performance tracking during editor usage (< 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS UI updates)
- **UI Architecture**: Performance tools use ONLY centralized scene structure from `addons/gfred2/scenes/docks/performance_profiler/` (ARCHITECTURE ESTABLISHED via GFRED2-011)
- **Profiler Interface**: Real-time monitoring panels ONLY from `addons/gfred2/scenes/components/performance_monitor/` (FOUNDATION COMPLETE)
- **NO MIXED APPROACHES**: Scene-based architecture exclusively, no programmatic UI construction allowed (COMPLIANCE ACHIEVED)
- **Architectural Compliance**: UI refactoring provides clean scene-based foundation for performance monitoring components

## Implementation Notes
- **Professional Tool**: Provides game development level performance analysis
- **Proactive Optimization**: Identifies issues during development, not after deployment
- **Educational Value**: Helps mission designers understand performance implications
- **Integration Showcase**: Demonstrates coordinated use of all foundation systems

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-001, GFRED2-002, GFRED2-003, GFRED2-004 (all integrations complete) - **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**  
- **Critical Foundation**: GFRED2-011 (UI Refactoring) - **COMPLETED** âœ…  
- **Blockers**: None - All foundation systems complete with scene-based architecture  
- **Related Stories**: Complements all mission creation workflows with performance awareness  
- **Implementation Ready**: Scene-based performance monitoring UI can be implemented immediately

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Mission performance profiler integrated with comprehensive analysis capabilities
- [ ] SEXP performance analysis identifies slow expressions with optimization suggestions
- [ ] Asset performance tracking shows resource usage and memory impact

- [ ] Performance comparison tools track optimization progress across mission versions
- [ ] Comprehensive performance reports exportable for documentation and analysis

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Integrate core foundation performance monitoring into mission editor
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create mission performance profiler with rendering, physics, and script analysis
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement SEXP performance analysis with optimization recommendations
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add asset performance tracking with resource usage visualization
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create real-time performance monitoring during editing and testing
- [ ] **Task 6**: Build optimization suggestion system with actionable recommendations
