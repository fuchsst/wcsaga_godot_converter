# User Story: Mission Component Editors

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-010  
**Created**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: Ready  
**Updated**: May 31, 2025  
**Priority**: High (Phase 4 Critical Feature Parity)

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer creating comprehensive mission scenarios  
**I want**: Specialized editors for all mission components (reinforcements, goals, messages, waypoints, environments)  
**So that**: I can create complete, professional missions with all necessary gameplay elements

## WCS Source Analysis Reference
**C++ Implementation**: `reinforcementeditordlg.cpp`, `missiongoalsdlg.cpp`, `messageeditordlg.cpp`, `waypointpathdlg.cpp`, `asteroideditordlg.cpp`, `starfieldeditor.cpp`, `addvariabledlg.cpp`, `modifyvariabledlg.cpp`  
**Key Features**: Reinforcement management, mission objectives, in-mission communications, waypoint paths, environment configuration, variable management  
**Complexity**: High - requires multiple specialized editors with complex validation and integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Reinforcement management system with arrival conditions and wave configuration
- [ ] **AC2**: Mission goals and objectives editor with primary/secondary/bonus goal types
- [ ] **AC3**: In-mission message system with timing, triggers, and voice integration
- [ ] **AC4**: Waypoint path editor with 3D visualization and ship assignment
- [ ] **AC5**: Asteroid field generator with density, composition, and hazard configuration
- [ ] **AC6**: Starfield and background editor with nebula and environmental effects
- [ ] **AC7**: Mission variable management with creation, modification, and usage tracking
- [ ] **AC8**: Environment configuration with jump nodes and special objects
- [ ] **AC9**: Integration validation ensuring all components work together correctly
- [ ] **AC10**: Export compatibility for all mission components with WCS format

## Technical Requirements
**Architecture Reference**: bmad-artifacts/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**

- **SEXP Integration**: Deep integration with EPIC-004 for triggers, conditions, and actions
- **Asset Integration**: Use EPIC-002 for ship, weapon, and environmental asset references
- **3D Visualization**: Real-time 3D preview for waypoints, asteroids, and environmental elements (< 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS UI updates)
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive validation ensuring component compatibility and correctness
- **Export Format**: Compatible export for all components using EPIC-003 conversion tools
- **UI Architecture**: Component editors use centralized scene structure from `addons/gfred2/scenes/dialogs/component_editors/` (ARCHITECTURE ESTABLISHED via GFRED2-011)
- **3D Preview**: Real-time environmental preview from `addons/gfred2/scenes/components/environment_preview_3d/` (FOUNDATION COMPLETE)
- **Architectural Compliance**: UI refactoring provides clean scene-based foundation for mission component editor UI

## Implementation Notes
- **Essential Components**: These editors cover critical mission elements missing from basic implementation
- **Complex Integration**: All components must integrate seamlessly with SEXP system and each other
- **Validation Critical**: Mission components must be validated for gameplay correctness
- **User Experience**: Editors must be intuitive while providing comprehensive functionality

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-002 (SEXP Integration), GFRED2-001 (Asset Integration), GFRED2-004 (Core Infrastructure) - **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**  
- **Critical Foundation**: GFRED2-011 (UI Refactoring) - **COMPLETED** âœ…  
- **Blockers**: None - All foundation systems complete with scene-based architecture  
- **Related Stories**: Completes core mission editing capabilities alongside other component stories  
- **Implementation Ready**: Scene-based component editor UI foundation established

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Reinforcement management system with comprehensive arrival and wave configuration
- [ ] Mission goals editor with all goal types and validation rules
- [ ] In-mission message system with timing, triggers, and audio integration
- [ ] Waypoint path editor with 3D visualization and ship assignment tools
- [ ] Asteroid field generator with realistic distribution and hazard systems
- [ ] Starfield and background editor with full environmental customization
- [ ] Mission variable management with creation, editing, and usage tracking
- [ ] Environment configuration system with jump nodes and special objects
- [ ] Integration validation ensuring all components work together correctly
- [ ] Export compatibility verified for all mission components

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 5 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design unified mission component editor interface with tab organization
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement reinforcement management system with arrival conditions
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create mission goals and objectives editor with validation
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build in-mission message system with timing and trigger integration
- [ ] **Task 5**: Develop waypoint path editor with 3D visualization
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create asteroid field generator with density and composition controls
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement starfield and background editor with environmental effects
- [ ] **Task 8**: Build mission variable management system with SEXP integration
- [ ] **Task 9**: Add environment configuration with jump nodes and special objects
- [ ] **Task 10**: Implement comprehensive validation and export for all components

## Testing Strategy
- **Component Tests**: Test each specialized editor with complex configuration scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Validate all components work together in complete missions
- **SEXP Tests**: Ensure proper integration with SEXP triggers and conditions
- **Export Tests**: Verify all components export correctly to WCS mission format

## Notes and Comments
**CRITICAL FEATURE GAP**: This story addresses multiple missing specialized editors identified by Larry's analysis. These mission component editors are essential for creating complete, professional missions that utilize all WCS gameplay elements.

Key capabilities from WCS FRED2:
- Reinforcement management with complex arrival conditions
- Mission goals and objectives with validation
- In-mission communications with timing control
- Waypoint path creation with 3D visualization
- Environment generation (asteroids, starfields, backgrounds)
- Mission variable management and tracking

This comprehensive set of mission component editors enables mission creators to build complete, sophisticated missions that leverage all WCS gameplay systems.
