# User Story: UI Modernization and Polish

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-005  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸ›‘ REQUIRES REWORK
**Updated**: June 7, 2025
**Review Date**: June 7, 2025

### Code Review Summary (June 7, 2025)
**Reviewer**: Cline (QA Specialist)
**Assessment**: ðŸ›‘ **REQUIRES REWORK**

**Critical Findings**:
1.  **Incomplete Docking System**: As noted in the story's own "Implementation Gap" section, the core docking functionality is incomplete. The `GFRED2DockManager` is missing key implementation details, such as the `move_dock()` function.
2.  **Blocked Functionality**: Without a fully functional docking system, the editor's UI cannot be customized by the user as intended, failing AC2.

**Action**: The `GFRED2DockManager` must be fully implemented to provide a robust and customizable docking system as per the story's requirements.

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer using GFRED2  
**I want**: A modern, polished UI that follows Godot editor conventions  
**So that**: The mission editor feels native to Godot and provides an excellent user experience

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: UI follows Godot editor design patterns and conventions consistently
- [ ] **AC2**: Dockable panels can be arranged and customized like native editor
- [x] **AC3**: Keyboard shortcuts are configurable and follow Godot standards
- [x] **AC4**: Context menus and toolbars provide efficient access to common operations
- [x] **AC5**: Visual feedback and progress indicators enhance user experience
- [x] **AC6**: Responsive UI adapts to different screen sizes (1920x1080 minimum to 4K)
- [x] **AC7**: Screen reader compatibility with NVDA and JAWS
- [x] **AC8**: Full keyboard navigation without mouse dependency
- [x] **AC9**: High contrast mode support and customizable UI themes
- [x] **AC10**: UI performance maintains 60+ FPS during all interactions
- [x] **AC11**: Integration with Godot editor theming system

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md` Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**
- **UI Framework**: Use Godot's native editor theming and styling with mandatory scene-based architecture
- **Docking System**: Implement proper editor dock integration with layout persistence using scenes (`addons/gfred2/scenes/docks/`)
- **Input System**: Standardized keyboard shortcuts and input handling with full accessibility
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for screen resolutions from 1920x1080 to 4K
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant UI elements and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering for smooth 60+ FPS interactions (< 16ms scene instantiation required)
- **Theming**: Integration with Godot editor theme system and custom theme support

## Implementation Notes
- **Native Integration**: Feels like part of Godot editor, not external tool
- **User Experience**: Focus on efficiency and discoverability
- **Modern Standards**: Contemporary UI patterns and interactions
- **Performance**: Smooth interactions even with complex missions
- **Implementation Gap (June 7, 2025)**: Analysis of `GFRED2DockManager` revealed that the core docking mechanism is incomplete. The `move_dock()` function is not implemented, and the strategy for how docks are managed (native Godot vs. custom) is unclear. This story is updated to include tasks to resolve this ambiguity and implement the missing functionality.

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-001, GFRED2-002, GFRED2-003 (core integrations complete)
- **Blockers**: None - builds on integrated foundation
- **Related Stories**: Enhances all mission editing workflows

## Definition of Done
- [x] UI matches Godot editor visual style and behavior across all themes
- [x] All panels can be docked, undocked, and rearranged with layout persistence
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts are configurable through standard settings
- [x] Full keyboard navigation tested and functional for all features
- [x] Screen reader compatibility validated with NVDA and JAWS
- [x] High contrast mode and theme integration working
- [x] Context menus provide comprehensive operation access
- [x] Visual feedback guides users through complex operations
- [x] Responsive design tested across multiple screen resolutions
- [x] All accessibility features tested with diverse user scenarios

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 4 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] **Task 1**: Apply consistent Godot editor theming with custom theme support
- [ ] **Task 2**: Clarify and implement the docking strategy for `GFRED2DockManager`. Decide whether to use Godot's native `EditorPlugin` docking system consistently or build a fully custom docking solution.
- [ ] **Task 2a**: If using native docking, refactor `add_dock` and `remove_dock` to correctly use `EditorPlugin.add_control_to_dock()` and `EditorPlugin.remove_control_from_docks()`.
- [ ] **Task 2b**: Implement the `move_dock(dock_name, new_slot)` function, using the chosen docking strategy.
- [x] **Task 3**: Create configurable keyboard shortcut system with accessibility support
- [x] **Task 4**: Implement full keyboard navigation for all UI components
- [x] **Task 5**: Add screen reader support with ARIA-compliant UI elements
- [x] **Task 6**: Design and implement context menus for efficient operations
- [x] **Task 7**: Add visual feedback and progress indicators with accessibility considerations
- [x] **Task 8**: Implement responsive layout system for multiple screen resolutions
- [x] **Task 9**: Add high contrast mode and comprehensive accessibility testing

## Testing Strategy
- **Usability Tests**: Test with mission designers for workflow efficiency
- **Visual Tests**: Ensure consistent appearance across different themes
- **Interaction Tests**: Validate smooth and responsive user interactions
- **Accessibility Tests**: Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

## Notes and Comments
**USER EXPERIENCE CRITICAL**: This story transforms GFRED2 from a functional tool into a polished, professional mission editor that feels native to Godot.

Key focus areas:
- Visual consistency with Godot editor
- Efficient workflows for common operations
- Discoverability of advanced features
- Smooth performance during intensive editing

This story should be implemented after core integrations are complete to provide the best foundation for UI improvements.
