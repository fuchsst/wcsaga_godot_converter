# User Story: Standardize MissionObject and MissionObjectData Naming

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-014  
**Created**: June 7, 2025  
**Status**: Ready  
**Priority**: High

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working on the GFRED2 codebase  
**I want**: Consistent naming for the core mission object data structures (`MissionObject` vs. `MissionObjectData`)  
**So that**: The codebase is easier to understand, maintain, and less prone to errors due_to_naming_confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: A single, consistent name (`MissionObject` or `MissionObjectData`) is chosen and used throughout the entire `gfred2` addon codebase.
- [ ] **AC2**: All class definitions, variable type hints, function parameters, and return types are updated to use the chosen standardized name.
- [ ] **AC3**: All filenames are updated to reflect the chosen standardized name (e.g., if `MissionObject` is chosen, `mission_object_data.gd` should be renamed or its content merged appropriately).
- [ ] **AC4**: All related `.uid` files are correctly updated or removed/regenerated by Godot.
- [ ] **AC5**: The editor functions correctly after the renaming, with no broken references.

## Technical Requirements
- **Refactoring Scope**: All GDScript files within `target/addons/gfred2/`.
- **Decision Point**: The team needs to decide whether `MissionObject` or `MissionObjectData` is the preferred name. `MissionObject` is generally more idiomatic for a class representing an entity.
- **Tooling**: Utilize IDE refactoring tools where possible, but manual verification will be essential.

## Implementation Notes
- **Consistency**: This task is crucial for improving code clarity and reducing cognitive load for developers.
- **Impact**: This is primarily a find-and-replace task across multiple files, but requires care to avoid breaking logic.
- **Related to Data Structures**: This directly impacts the core data representation of mission entities.

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: None, but best done when other major refactorings are stable.
- **Blockers**: None.
- **Related Stories**: Affects any story that interacts with mission objects.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] The chosen standardized name is used exclusively in all relevant files.
- [ ] All associated `.gd` and `.uid` files are correctly named and referenced.
- [ ] The GFRED2 editor compiles and runs without errors related to this renaming.
- [ ] A brief note is added to project documentation or `CLAUDE.md` in `gfred2` about the chosen standard name.

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium (tedious but straightforward)
- **Effort**: 1 day
- **Risk Level**: Medium (risk of breaking references if not done carefully)
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Decide on the standard name (e.g., `MissionObject`).
- [ ] **Task 2**: Identify all occurrences of the non-standard name(s) in the codebase.
- [ ] **Task 3**: Rename the class definition in the primary script file (e.g., `mission_object.gd` or `mission_object_data.gd`).
- [ ] **Task 4**: Rename the script file itself if necessary.
- [ ] **Task 5**: Update all type hints, variable declarations, function parameters, and return types across the `gfred2` addon to use the standardized name.
- [ ] **Task 6**: Test the editor thoroughly to ensure all functionality remains intact.

## Testing Strategy
- **Full Editor Test**: After refactoring, perform a comprehensive test of all editor features, especially those involving object creation, selection, modification, and deletion.
- **Code Review**: Have another developer review the changes to catch any missed references.

## Notes and Comments
This refactoring will significantly improve the consistency and readability of the `gfred2` codebase.
