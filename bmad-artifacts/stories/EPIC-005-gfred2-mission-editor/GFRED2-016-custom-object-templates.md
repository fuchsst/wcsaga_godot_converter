# User Story: Implement Custom Object Templates in ObjectFactory

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-016  
**Created**: June 7, 2025  
**Status**: Ready  
**Priority**: Medium

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer  
**I want**: To create, save, and use custom object templates in the `ObjectFactory`  
**So that**: I can quickly reuse complex object configurations and speed up mission design.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: GFRED2 allows defining a `MissionObject`'s current state (properties, SEXP variables, etc.) as a new template.
- [ ] **AC2**: Custom templates can be saved as Godot resources (e.g., `.tres` files) in a user-defined or project-specific location.
- [ ] **AC3**: The `ObjectFactory` can list and load these custom templates.
- [ ] **AC4**: Creating an object from a custom template correctly applies all saved properties and configurations.
- [ ] **AC5**: Custom templates are integrated with the asset browser or a dedicated template browser for easy access.
- [ ] **AC6**: The system supports organizing custom templates (e.g., by category or folder).

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: bmad-artifacts/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md
- **Core Component**: `target/addons/gfred2/object_management/object_factory.gd`
- **Data Format**: Custom templates should be instances of `MissionObject` or a new `MissionObjectTemplate` resource, saved as `.tres` files.
- **Integration**: Needs integration with `MissionObjectManager` for creating instances and `MissionFileIO` (or direct `ResourceSaver`) for saving/loading template resources.
- **UI**: Requires UI elements for saving an object as a template and for browsing/selecting templates. This UI should be scene-based.

## Implementation Notes
- **Productivity Feature**: Greatly enhances designer workflow for complex missions.
- **Extensibility**: Allows designers to build libraries of reusable mission components.
- **Resource Management**: Leverages Godot's resource system for template storage.

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: `ObjectFactory` and `MissionObject` systems must be stable. `GFRED2-012` (Object Duplication) should be complete as it involves similar data handling.
- **Blockers**: None.
- **Related Stories**: Complements object creation and management features.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can save any configured `MissionObject` as a custom template.
- [ ] Users can create new objects based on saved custom templates.
- [ ] The `ObjectFactory` correctly lists and applies custom templates.
- [ ] Custom templates are persistent and can be shared between projects/users if desired.
- [ ] UI for managing custom templates is intuitive and follows scene-based architecture.

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design the `MissionObjectTemplate` resource (if needed) or decide to use `MissionObject` directly for templates.
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement "Save as Template" functionality (e.g., in the object property editor's context menu).
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement logic in `ObjectFactory` to discover and load custom templates from a designated directory.
- [ ] **Task 4**: Update the object creation UI (e.g., asset browser or a new template browser) to list and use custom templates.
- [ ] **Task 5**: Ensure that applying a template correctly instantiates and configures a new `MissionObject`.
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add tests for saving, loading, and applying custom templates.

## Testing Strategy
- **Functional Tests**: Create various objects, save them as templates, then create new objects from these templates and verify all properties are correct.
- **Usability Tests**: Ensure the workflow for creating and using templates is intuitive for designers.

## Notes and Comments
This feature adds significant power and flexibility for mission designers.
