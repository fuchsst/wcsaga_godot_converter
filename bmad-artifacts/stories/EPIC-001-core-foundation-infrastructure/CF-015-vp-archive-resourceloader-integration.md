# User Story: VP Archive ResourceLoader Integration

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-015  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer converting WCS assets and data for use in Godot  
**I want**: VP archive files to load seamlessly through Godot's ResourceLoader system as native Godot resources  
**So that**: WCS assets (models, textures, missions, tables) can be accessed using standard Godot resource loading patterns without custom file I/O code

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Custom ResourceFormatLoader for VP archives is implemented and registered with Godot's ResourceLoader
- [ ] **AC2**: VP archive files can be loaded using standard Godot syntax: `load("res://data/models.vp")`
- [ ] **AC3**: Individual files within VP archives can be accessed using virtual paths: `load("res://models.vp/fighter.pof")`
- [ ] **AC4**: VP file contents are properly cached and managed to prevent memory leaks and excessive I/O
- [ ] **AC5**: Error handling provides clear diagnostic messages for corrupted or missing VP files
- [ ] **AC6**: Integration with existing VPArchive class preserves all low-level VP reading functionality

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Foundation Layer Structure - Asset Management section, VPArchive integration
- **Godot Components**: ResourceFormatLoader, ResourceLoader registration, custom Resource classes
- **Integration Points**: Asset Management Addon (EPIC-003), Mission Data Loading, Model Loading systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/cfile/cfilearchive.cpp` - WCS VP archive file system implementation
- **Godot Approach**: Extend ResourceFormatLoader, integrate with Godot's resource caching, maintain VPArchive compatibility
- **Key Challenges**: Mapping VP internal paths to Godot resource paths, efficient caching, resource lifecycle management
- **Success Metrics**: Standard Godot resource loading syntax works transparently with VP archives

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-013 (Project Configuration), existing VPArchive implementation must be functional
- **Blockers**: VPArchive class must read VP files correctly (currently implemented but needs integration)
- **Related Stories**: CF-004 (VP Archive Loader) provides foundation, future asset management stories depend on this

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] ResourceFormatLoader implementation follows Godot best practices and patterns
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with real VP archive files
- [ ] Integration testing validates resource loading through standard Godot APIs
- [ ] Performance testing ensures efficient caching and minimal I/O overhead
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage examples and API reference
- [ ] Memory management prevents leaks during resource loading/unloading

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Study Godot ResourceFormatLoader API and best practices for custom formats
- [ ] **Task 2**: Design VP resource path mapping system (VP file paths to Godot resource paths)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement VPResourceFormatLoader class extending ResourceFormatLoader
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create VP resource caching system to prevent redundant file I/O
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate with existing VPArchive class for low-level file reading
- [ ] **Task 6**: Register VP loader with Godot's ResourceLoader system
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement error handling and diagnostic reporting
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive tests with real WCS VP files
- [ ] **Task 9**: Create usage documentation and examples

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: VP resource loading, path mapping, caching behavior, error conditions
- **Integration Tests**: Standard Godot resource loading APIs, ResourceLoader registration
- **Performance Tests**: Large VP file loading, memory usage validation, cache efficiency
- **Manual Tests**: Load real WCS VP files using standard Godot `load()` calls

## Notes and Comments
**FOUNDATION SCOPE**: This story completes the VP archive foundation by making VP files work transparently with Godot's resource system. It bridges the low-level VPArchive implementation with high-level Godot resource management.

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION**: This functionality is essential for EPIC-003 (Asset Structures Management) and all future asset loading. Without this, WCS assets cannot be loaded using standard Godot patterns.

**PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: VP files can be large (100+ MB). The implementation must handle caching and memory management efficiently to prevent performance issues.

**COMPATIBILITY**: Must maintain full compatibility with existing VPArchive class while adding Godot ResourceLoader integration.
