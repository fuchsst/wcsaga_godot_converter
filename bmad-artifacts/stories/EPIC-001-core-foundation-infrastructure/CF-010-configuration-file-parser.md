# User Story: Configuration File Parser

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-010  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working with WCS configuration data and settings  
**I want**: A robust configuration file parsing system that handles WCS data formats  
**So that**: All WCS configuration files can be processed correctly and converted to Godot-native Resource formats

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: ConfigParser class handles WCS table file format (.tbl) with complete syntax support
- [ ] **AC2**: Parser converts WCS configuration data to typed Godot Resource (.tres) files automatically
- [ ] **AC3**: Error handling provides detailed feedback for syntax errors, missing values, and validation failures
- [ ] **AC4**: Integration with EPIC-003 migration tools for batch conversion of WCS configuration data
- [ ] **AC5**: Runtime configuration loading supports both converted .tres files and legacy .tbl formats
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance optimized for large configuration files with thousands of entries (specific table content handling belongs to other EPICs)

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Data Parsing Framework - Configuration File Parser section
- **Godot Components**: Custom parser classes, Resource serialization, integration with migration tools
- **Integration Points**: EPIC-003 migration tools, Asset Management addon (EPIC-002), all data-dependent systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/parse/parselo.cpp`, WCS table file format specification
- **Godot Approach**: Parse WCS format and convert to typed Godot Resources, support both runtime and migration usage
- **Key Challenges**: Complex WCS table syntax, ensuring data integrity during conversion, performance with large files
- **Success Metrics**: 100% WCS configuration compatibility, seamless integration with migration workflow

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (System Globals), CF-005 (File System Abstraction), EPIC-003 migration tools architecture
- **Blockers**: None - builds on foundation components
- **Related Stories**: CF-011 (Table Parser), CF-012 (Validation), integration with EPIC-002 asset management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration with migration tools validated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance validated with real WCS configuration files

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS parselo.cpp and table file format specifications
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create ConfigParser class with WCS table file syntax support
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement Resource conversion system for creating typed .tres files
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add comprehensive error handling and syntax validation
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate with EPIC-003 migration tools for batch conversion workflow
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement runtime loading support for both .tres and legacy .tbl formats
- [ ] **Task 7**: Optimize performance for large configuration files
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive tests with real WCS configuration data

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test parser with various WCS table file formats and edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Verify migration tool integration and Resource conversion
- **Performance Tests**: Validate parsing performance with large WCS configuration files
- **Compatibility Tests**: Ensure 100% compatibility with existing WCS configuration data

## Notes and Comments
**FOUNDATION SCOPE**: This story provides ONLY the configuration parsing framework. Specific configuration content handling (ship stats, weapon data) belongs to other EPICs that will use this foundation.

This parser is crucial for the migration workflow and must handle all WCS configuration formats correctly. Focus on robust error handling and clear integration with the migration tools from EPIC-003. The dual support for both .tres and .tbl formats ensures flexibility during development and migration phases.
