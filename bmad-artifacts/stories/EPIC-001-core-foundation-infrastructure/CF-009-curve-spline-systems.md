**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer implementing WCS animation and path systems  
**I want**: Curve and spline mathematical operations for smooth animations and motion paths  
**So that**: Ship paths, camera movements, and animations maintain the smooth, cinematic quality of the original game

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: CurveMath class implements spline interpolation matching WCS curve behavior and quality
- [ ] **AC2**: Bezier curve support for complex path animations with proper control point handling
- [ ] **AC3**: Integration with Godot's Curve and Path3D systems while maintaining WCS mathematical accuracy
- [ ] **AC4**: Performance optimization ensures smooth real-time curve evaluation for multiple objects
- [ ] **AC5**: Curve manipulation tools support dynamic path modification during gameplay
- [ ] **AC6**: Mathematical precision maintains smooth motion without visible artifacts or stuttering

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Mathematical Framework - Curve and Spline Systems section
- **Godot Components**: Integration with Godot's Curve, Path3D, and animation systems
- **Integration Points**: Animation systems, camera movement, ship AI pathfinding, cinematic sequences

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/math/spline.cpp`, curve mathematics and animation systems
- **Godot Approach**: Extend Godot's curve systems with WCS-specific interpolation and precision
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining smooth motion quality while optimizing for real-time performance
- **Success Metrics**: Smooth curves with no visible artifacts, performance suitable for real-time use

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-007 (Vector/Matrix Operations) for mathematical foundation
- **Blockers**: None - builds on mathematical framework
- **Related Stories**: Future animation and AI pathfinding systems will use these curve functions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Curve smoothness and quality validated visually
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance validated for real-time curve evaluation

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS spline.cpp for curve mathematics and interpolation algorithms
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create CurveMath class with spline interpolation functions
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement Bezier curve support with proper control point handling
- [ ] **Task 4**: Integrate with Godot's Curve and Path3D systems for compatibility
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add performance optimization for real-time curve evaluation
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create curve manipulation tools for dynamic path modification
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive tests and validate curve smoothness
- [ ] **Task 8**: Document mathematical specifications and usage examples

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test curve interpolation with various control points and parameters

- **Integration Tests**: Test integration with Godot's animation and path systems

## Notes and Comments
Curve quality is important for the cinematic feel of WCS. Focus on smooth, artifact-free interpolation that maintains visual quality. The integration with Godot's systems should enhance usability while preserving mathematical accuracy. Performance is important since curves may be evaluated every frame for multiple objects.
