# User Story: Data Table Processing System

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-011  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working with WCS data tables and game definitions  
**I want**: A specialized data table processing system for structured WCS data  
**So that**: Complex data tables (ships, weapons, AI profiles) can be processed efficiently and converted to typed Godot Resources

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: TableProcessor class handles structured WCS data tables with hierarchical data and references
- [ ] **AC2**: Automatic type inference creates properly typed Godot Resource classes for different data categories
- [ ] **AC3**: Reference resolution system handles cross-table dependencies and inheritance structures
- [ ] **AC4**: Integration with Asset Management addon (EPIC-002) for seamless asset pipeline workflow
- [ ] **AC5**: Data validation framework for table processing (specific data validation rules belong to other EPICs)
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance optimization handles large tables efficiently with streaming and memory management

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Data Parsing Framework - Data Table Processing section
- **Godot Components**: Resource system integration, custom type generation, plugin architecture support
- **Integration Points**: EPIC-002 Asset Management addon, EPIC-003 migration tools, all data-dependent systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: WCS table formats (ships.tbl, weapons.tbl, AI_profiles.tbl), data relationship patterns
- **Godot Approach**: Process structured data into typed Resources, leverage addon system for asset pipeline integration
- **Key Challenges**: Complex data relationships, type inference, maintaining referential integrity
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS data tables process correctly with proper typing and cross-references

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-010 (Configuration Parser), EPIC-002 addon architecture, EPIC-003 migration tools
- **Blockers**: Asset Management addon structure must be defined
- **Related Stories**: CF-012 (Validation), integration with asset management workflow

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration with addon architecture validated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance validated with complex WCS data tables

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS structured data table formats and relationship patterns
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create TableProcessor class with hierarchical data handling
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement automatic type inference and Resource class generation
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add reference resolution system for cross-table dependencies
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate with EPIC-002 Asset Management addon architecture
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement data validation and referential integrity checking
- [ ] **Task 7**: Optimize performance for large table processing with memory management
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive tests with real WCS data tables

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test table processing with various data structures and relationships
- **Integration Tests**: Verify addon integration and asset pipeline workflow
- **Performance Tests**: Validate processing performance with large WCS data tables
- **Data Integrity Tests**: Ensure referential integrity and type correctness

## Notes and Comments
**FOUNDATION SCOPE**: This story provides ONLY the data table processing framework. Specific table content processing (ships.tbl, weapons.tbl parsing) belongs to other EPICs that will use this foundation.

This processing system is critical for the data migration workflow and must handle complex WCS data relationships correctly. The integration with the addon architecture ensures seamless asset pipeline workflow. Focus on maintaining data integrity while optimizing for performance with large datasets.
