## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Mathematical Framework - Physics and Collision Mathematics section
- **Godot Components**: Integration with PhysicsServer3D, custom physics calculations
- **Integration Points**: Core physics system, collision detection, ship movement, weapon ballistics

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/math/fvi.cpp`, `physics.cpp`, collision and physics math implementations
- **Godot Approach**: Hybrid system using Godot physics where beneficial, custom math for WCS accuracy
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing WCS accuracy with Godot performance, maintaining exact movement feel
- **Success Metrics**: Ship movement feels identical to WCS, collision detection accuracy matches exactly

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-007 (Vector/Matrix Operations) for mathematical foundation

- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance validated for 60Hz with 100+ objects

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS physics math from fvi.cpp and physics.cpp implementations

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test physics calculations with known scenarios and expected outcomes
- **Behavioral Tests**: Compare ship movement and collision behavior with original WCS
- **Performance Tests**: Validate 60Hz performance target with realistic object counts
- **Integration Tests**: Test physics integration with Godot's physics engine

## Notes and Comments
**FOUNDATION SCOPE**: This story provides ONLY the mathematical framework for physics calculations. Specific gameplay implementations (ship controls, weapon ballistics) belong to other EPICs that will use this foundation.

This is the most critical story for maintaining WCS mathematical accuracy. Physics precision is non-negotiable - the mathematical foundation must be exact. Focus on getting the calculations exactly right before optimizing performance. The hybrid approach with Godot physics should enhance performance without changing behavior.
