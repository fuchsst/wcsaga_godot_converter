# User Story: ObjectManager Autoload Implementation

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-014  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer implementing WCS game object management in Godot  
**I want**: A complete ObjectManager autoload that handles WCS object lifecycle, pooling, and update coordination  
**So that**: All game systems can create, manage, and destroy WCS objects using a centralized, performant system that matches the original WCS architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: ObjectManager autoload is implemented with full static typing and loads without errors
- [ ] **AC2**: Core object lifecycle methods (create_object, destroy_object, get_objects_by_type) function correctly
- [ ] **AC3**: Object pooling system works for frequently created objects (bullets, particles, effects)
- [ ] **AC4**: Update frequency grouping allows objects to update at different rates (60Hz, 30Hz, 10Hz, 1Hz)
- [ ] **AC5**: Integration with WCSObject base class enables proper object registration and management
- [ ] **AC6**: Memory management prevents object leaks and handles cleanup correctly during scene transitions

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Foundation Layer Structure - ObjectManager (AUTOLOAD) section
- **Godot Components**: Autoload singleton, object pooling, update management, WCSObject integration
- **Integration Points**: Core foundation for all game objects, physics systems, rendering, and gameplay logic

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/object/object.cpp` - WCS object management and lifecycle
- **Godot Approach**: Use Node-based object management with pooling, leverage Godot's scene system
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing WCS compatibility with Godot performance, efficient object pooling
- **Success Metrics**: 100+ objects managed at 60Hz without performance degradation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-013 (Project Configuration) - ObjectManager must be correctly referenced in autoloads
- **Blockers**: WCSObject base class must be accessible and functional
- **Related Stories**: All other foundation stories depend on ObjectManager for object lifecycle

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage using gdUnit4
- [ ] Integration testing with WCSObject base class completed
- [ ] Performance testing validates 100+ object management at target frame rates
- [ ] Memory leak testing confirms proper cleanup and pooling behavior
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create ObjectManager autoload script with proper class structure and signals
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement core object lifecycle methods (create, destroy, find, manage)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design and implement object pooling system for efficient memory management
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create update frequency grouping system for performance optimization
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate with WCSObject base class for automatic registration/deregistration
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add error handling and validation for object operations
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement memory management and cleanup systems
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive unit tests and performance benchmarks

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Object creation/destruction, pooling behavior, update frequency management
- **Performance Tests**: 100+ objects at 60Hz, memory usage validation, pool efficiency
- **Integration Tests**: WCSObject integration, autoload accessibility, scene transition behavior
- **Manual Tests**: Visual validation of object management in game scenarios

## Notes and Comments
**ARCHITECTURE CRITICAL**: This ObjectManager is referenced throughout the codebase and is essential for the WCS object system architecture. It must match the approved architectural design exactly.

**PERFORMANCE FOCUS**: The original WCS handled 100+ objects efficiently. The Godot implementation must meet or exceed this performance while providing better memory management through pooling.

**WCS COMPATIBILITY**: While using Godot's Node system, the API should feel familiar to WCS developers and preserve the same object lifecycle patterns.
