# User Story: Resource Caching and Management

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-006  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer optimizing WCS asset loading and memory usage  
**I want**: An intelligent resource caching system that manages memory efficiently  
**So that**: Assets are loaded quickly, memory usage is controlled, and the game maintains smooth performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: ResourceCache autoload provides intelligent caching with configurable memory limits and LRU eviction
- [ ] **AC2**: Asset preloading system loads commonly used resources at startup to minimize runtime loading
- [ ] **AC3**: Memory monitoring tracks resource usage and provides warnings when approaching limits
- [ ] **AC4**: Cache invalidation system handles asset changes during development with hot-reloading support
- [ ] **AC5**: Resource sharing prevents duplicate loading of identical assets from different requests
- [ ] **AC6**: Cache performance metrics track hit/miss ratios and loading times for optimization

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: File System Foundation - Resource Caching section
- **Godot Components**: Autoload singleton, integration with Godot's ResourceLoader and caching
- **Integration Points**: Used by all asset-dependent systems for optimized resource access

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Asset loading patterns from various WCS systems, memory management strategies
- **Godot Approach**: Extend Godot's resource caching with WCS-specific optimizations and monitoring
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing memory usage vs performance, implementing effective cache eviction policies
- **Success Metrics**: 90%+ cache hit ratio for common assets, <100MB cache memory footprint

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-005 (File System Abstraction) for unified file access, CF-003 (Debug Manager) for monitoring
- **Blockers**: None - builds on completed foundation components
- **Related Stories**: All future asset-dependent systems will use this caching layer

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Memory usage testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Cache performance validated against target metrics

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design cache architecture with configurable memory limits and eviction policies
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create ResourceCache autoload with LRU cache implementation
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement asset preloading system for commonly used resources
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add memory monitoring and usage tracking with warning thresholds
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create cache invalidation system supporting hot-reloading during development
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement resource sharing to prevent duplicate asset loading
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add performance metrics collection and reporting
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive tests and validate against memory and performance targets

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test cache operations, eviction policies, and memory management
- **Integration Tests**: Verify cache integration with file system and resource loading
- **Performance Tests**: Measure cache hit ratios, loading times, and memory usage
- **Stress Tests**: Test cache behavior under high memory pressure and rapid asset loading

## Notes and Comments
This caching system is critical for game performance and memory efficiency. Focus on intelligent caching policies that understand WCS asset usage patterns. The hot-reloading support is important for development workflow. Monitor cache effectiveness closely and be prepared to tune eviction policies based on real usage data.
