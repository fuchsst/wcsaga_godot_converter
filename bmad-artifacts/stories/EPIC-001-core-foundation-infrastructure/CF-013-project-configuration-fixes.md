# User Story: Project Configuration and Dependency Resolution

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-013  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working on the WCS-Godot conversion project  
**I want**: A properly configured Godot project with all dependencies resolved and autoloads functioning correctly  
**So that**: The project can start without errors, tests can execute, and development can proceed on other foundation components

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Project starts without any parse errors or autoload failures when launched in Godot editor
- [ ] **AC2**: All autoload references in project.godot point to existing, valid script files
- [ ] **AC3**: Missing addon dependencies are either removed from project configuration or properly implemented
- [ ] **AC4**: Boot splash image path is corrected or asset is provided
- [ ] **AC5**: All GDScript files referenced in autoloads compile successfully without parser errors
- [ ] **AC6**: Test infrastructure (gdUnit4) can execute basic tests without project configuration errors

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Foundation Layer Structure - Manager Autoloads section
- **Godot Components**: project.godot configuration, autoload system, basic scene structure
- **Integration Points**: Enables all other foundation systems to load and function properly

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: N/A - This is a Godot project configuration issue
- **Godot Approach**: Fix project.godot autoload paths, resolve missing dependencies, ensure clean project startup
- **Key Challenges**: Identifying all missing dependencies without breaking existing functionality
- **Success Metrics**: Project starts cleanly, no console errors, tests can run

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: None (this is a foundational fix)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: CF-014 (ObjectManager), CF-015 (VP Archive) depend on this fix

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Project starts cleanly in Godot editor without errors
- [ ] All autoloads load successfully and are accessible
- [ ] Basic test execution works (even if specific tests fail)
- [ ] Project configuration documented and validated
- [ ] No more parse errors or missing dependency warnings

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 1-2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Audit all autoload entries in project.godot and verify file existence
- [ ] **Task 2**: Remove or replace missing addon dependencies (scene_manager, SignalVisualizer)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Fix boot splash image path or provide missing asset
- [ ] **Task 4**: Resolve ObjectManager autoload dependency by creating stub or fixing reference
- [ ] **Task 5**: Test project startup and fix any remaining configuration issues
- [ ] **Task 6**: Validate that gdUnit4 test framework can execute basic tests
- [ ] **Task 7**: Document final project configuration and autoload dependencies

## Testing Strategy
- **Manual Tests**: Project startup in Godot editor, autoload accessibility test
- **Integration Tests**: Basic test framework execution to verify configuration
- **Validation Tests**: All autoloads can be accessed without errors

## Notes and Comments
**CRITICAL FOUNDATION**: This story must be completed before any other EPIC-001 work can proceed. The project configuration issues are blocking all development and testing activities.

**PRIORITY**: This is the highest priority remediation story as it enables all other work.
