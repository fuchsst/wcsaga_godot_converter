- [x] **AC2**: Shield quadrant system manages four independent shield sections with directional damage absorption and recharge mechanics
- [x] **AC3**: Hull damage processing applies armor resistance calculations and triggers death sequences at zero hull
- [x] **AC4**: Subsystem damage system distributes damage to ship components and applies realistic functionality loss
- [x] **AC5**: Combat state management tracks damage accumulation, combat effectiveness, and applies appropriate visual/audio feedback
- [x] **AC6**: Armor and resistance system handles multiple armor types with weapon-specific damage modifications
- [x] **AC7**: Performance optimization ensures smooth combat with multiple ships and complex damage calculations

## Technical Requirements
