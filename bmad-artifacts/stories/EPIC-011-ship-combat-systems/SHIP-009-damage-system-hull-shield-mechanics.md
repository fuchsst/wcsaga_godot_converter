## System Integration Requirements

### Ship Controller Integration
- **Health Status**: Central health tracking coordinates with damage system for overall ship status
- **Performance Effects**: Hull damage affects ship speed, maneuverability, and system efficiency
- **State Management**: Damage states integrated with ship lifecycle and operational status
- **Emergency Protocols**: Critical damage triggers emergency behaviors and failure modes

### Subsystem Manager Integration
- **Damage Distribution**: Hull damage distributes to subsystems based on hit location and damage type
- **Performance Degradation**: Subsystem damage affects functionality through realistic degradation curves
- **Cascade Effects**: Subsystem failures can trigger additional damage and system interactions
- **Repair Coordination**: Damage system coordinates with repair mechanics for authentic restoration

### Weapon Systems Integration
- **Damage Application**: Weapon impacts apply damage through standardized damage system interface
- **Damage Types**: Different weapon types (energy, kinetic, explosive) apply damage through appropriate calculations
- **Critical Hits**: Weapon systems can trigger critical damage effects through damage system
- **Penetration Mechanics**: Armor penetration calculations determine damage effectiveness

### Shield System Integration
- **Quadrant Management**: Shield quadrants absorb damage before hull impact with realistic distribution
- **Shield Effectiveness**: Shield strength affects damage reduction and penetration resistance
- **Quadrant Targeting**: Weapon targeting can focus on specific shield quadrants for tactical advantage
- **Shield Failure**: Shield quadrant failure exposes hull to direct damage with appropriate effects

### Visual Effects Integration
- **Damage Representation**: Damage states trigger appropriate visual effects and model changes
- **Real-time Feedback**: Damage application provides immediate visual and audio feedback
- **Progressive Damage**: Visual damage accumulates realistically with hull integrity degradation
- **Shield Effects**: Shield impacts and failures display appropriate visual indicators

### Physics System Integration
- **Collision Detection**: Physics system reports collision events for impact damage calculation
- **Impact Damage**: Collision velocity and mass determine impact damage through physics calculations

### Mission System Integration
- **Damage Events**: Mission system responds to ship damage states and critical failures
- **Victory Conditions**: Mission objectives can depend on ship damage states and survival
- **Scripted Damage**: Mission scripts can apply specific damage for story events

## Notes and Comments
- Hull damage must accurately reflect WCS subsystem targeting and damage distribution
- Shield quadrant mechanics are critical for authentic WCS combat feel
- Armor resistance calculations must consider ship class, hit location, and weapon type
- Visual damage feedback should be immediate and clearly communicate ship status
- Performance optimization essential for large-scale combat scenarios
