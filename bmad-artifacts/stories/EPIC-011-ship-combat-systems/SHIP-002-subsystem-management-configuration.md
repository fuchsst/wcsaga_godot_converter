# User Story: Subsystem Management and Configuration

**Epic**: EPIC-011: Ship & Combat Systems  
**Story ID**: SHIP-002  
**Created**: 2025-06-08  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game developer implementing the WCS-Godot conversion  
**I want**: A comprehensive subsystem management system that handles ship component health, performance effects, and damage modeling  
**So that**: Ships have realistic subsystem damage that affects performance authentically, maintaining WCS combat depth and tactical complexity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: SubsystemManager handles engine, weapon, shield, sensor, communication, and navigation subsystems with WCS-authentic types
- [ ] **AC2**: Subsystem health tracking affects ship performance realistically (engines affect speed, weapons affect firing, shields affect protection)
- [ ] **AC3**: Performance degradation follows WCS curves (engines: 50%/30% thresholds, weapons: 70% threshold, etc.)
- [ ] **AC4**: Subsystem damage allocation uses proximity-based damage distribution from impact points
- [ ] **AC5**: Turret subsystems implement independent AI targeting with multi-criteria target selection
- [ ] **AC6**: Subsystem repair and recovery mechanisms restore functionality over time
- [ ] **AC7**: SEXP integration enables mission scripting to query subsystem status and trigger events

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-011-ship-combat-systems/architecture.md - Subsystem Management section
- **Godot Components**: SubsystemManager node, Subsystem resources, signal-based communication
- **Integration Points**: 
  - **WCS Asset Core**: Subsystem definitions and model associations
  - **Damage System**: Proximity damage calculations and armor integration
  - **SEXP System**: Mission scripting queries and condition checking
  - **AI Systems**: Turret AI behavior and target selection
  - **Physics System**: Performance modification and movement constraints

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: source/code/ship/ship.h (ship_subsys), source/code/ship/shiphit.cpp (damage allocation)
- **Godot Approach**: Node-based subsystem management with Resource definitions, signals for state changes
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining WCS performance curves while integrating with Godot's scene system
- **Success Metrics**: Subsystem damage affects ship performance identically to WCS, turret AI behaves authentically

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: SHIP-001 (BaseShip foundation), EPIC-002 asset structures for subsystem definitions
- **Blockers**: Damage system integration, SEXP system for mission scripting
- **Related Stories**: SHIP-001 (Ship Controller), SHIP-009 (Damage System), SEXP-007 (Mission Events)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create Subsystem and SubsystemDefinition resource classes with WCS subsystem types
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement SubsystemManager for lifecycle management and state coordination
- [ ] **Task 3**: Add performance degradation calculations based on subsystem health percentages
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create proximity-based damage allocation system for realistic impact distribution
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement turret subsystem with independent AI targeting and accuracy modeling
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add subsystem repair/recovery mechanisms with configurable rates
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create SEXP integration interfaces for mission scripting access
- [ ] **Task 8**: Implement signal-based communication for performance effects on ship systems

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Subsystem creation and configuration
  - Performance degradation calculations
  - Damage allocation algorithms
  - Repair rate calculations
  - SEXP query interfaces
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Ship performance modification verification
  - Damage system integration
  - Turret AI behavior validation
  - Mission scripting functionality
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Subsystem damage affects ship performance like WCS
  - Turret targeting behaves authentically
  - Repair systems restore functionality correctly

## System Integration Requirements

### WCS Asset Core Integration
- **Subsystem Definitions**: Load from ship class definitions and model associations
- **Configuration Data**: Subsystem health values, performance thresholds, repair rates
- **Model Integration**: 3D model attachment points, visual damage states

### SEXP System Integration  
- **Status Queries**: `(is-subsystem-functional ship subsystem)`, `(subsystem-health ship subsystem)`
- **Event Triggers**: Subsystem destruction events, performance threshold crossings
- **Mission Logic**: Subsystem-based win/loss conditions, objective states

### Damage System Integration
- **Proximity Calculations**: Distance-based damage distribution to nearest subsystems
- **Armor Interaction**: Subsystem-specific armor values and damage reduction
- **Cascading Failures**: Dependent subsystem shutdowns (navigation requires engines)

### AI System Integration
- **Turret AI**: Independent targeting with priority systems (fighters > bombers > capitals)
- **Performance AI**: Ship AI adapts behavior based on subsystem damage
- **Accuracy Modeling**: Sensor damage affects targeting precision

### Physics System Integration
- **Movement Modification**: Engine damage reduces max speed and acceleration
- **Rotation Limits**: Damaged engines affect maneuverability
- **Shield Effectiveness**: Shield generator health affects regeneration and coverage

## Notes and Comments
- SubsystemManager must maintain WCS performance characteristics while leveraging Godot nodes
- Turret AI should be independently configurable and reusable across ship types
- Signal architecture critical for real-time performance updates to ship systems
- Memory efficiency important for large fleet battles with many subsystems
