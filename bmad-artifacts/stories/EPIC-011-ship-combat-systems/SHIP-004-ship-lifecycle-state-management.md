# User Story: Ship Lifecycle and State Management

**Epic**: EPIC-011: Ship & Combat Systems  
**Story ID**: SHIP-004  
**Created**: 2025-06-08  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game developer implementing the WCS-Godot conversion  
**I want**: A comprehensive ship lifecycle and state management system that tracks ship status throughout their operational life  
**So that**: Ships maintain proper state consistency, handle lifecycle transitions correctly, and integrate seamlessly with mission and persistence systems

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Ship state management tracks all WCS ship flags (mission-persistent and runtime states) with proper state validation
- [ ] **AC2**: Ship lifecycle events handle creation, activation, arrival, departure, and destruction sequences authentically
- [ ] **AC3**: State transitions manage arrival phases (ARRIVING_STAGE_1 → ARRIVING_STAGE_2 → ACTIVE) with proper validation
- [ ] **AC4**: Combat state tracking handles damage accumulation, dying sequences, and destruction events
- [ ] **AC5**: Team and IFF management maintains proper faction relationships and combat targeting rules
- [ ] **AC6**: Integration with mission system handles arrival/departure cues, red alert persistence, and logging
- [ ] **AC7**: Save/load system preserves ship state across mission transitions and red alert scenarios

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-011-ship-combat-systems/architecture.md - Ship Foundation section
- **Godot Components**: State management nodes, lifecycle controllers, signal-based state changes
- **Integration Points**: 
  - **Mission System**: Arrival/departure triggers, mission event integration, red alert state
  - **Save/Load System**: State persistence, mission transition handling, damage tracking
  - **AI System**: Goal management, behavior state synchronization, formation tracking
  - **Object System**: Physics lifecycle, collision state, resource management
  - **Team Management**: IFF relationships, faction alignment, combat targeting
  - **Wing System**: Formation status, group behaviors, command hierarchy

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: source/code/ship/ship.cpp (lifecycle), source/code/object/object.cpp (state management)
- **Godot Approach**: State machine patterns with signal-based transitions, Godot's node lifecycle integration
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining WCS state complexity while leveraging Godot's scene system efficiently
- **Success Metrics**: Ship states transition identically to WCS, save/load preserves all state correctly

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: SHIP-001 (BaseShip), SHIP-002 (Subsystem Management), SHIP-003 (Ship Factory)
- **Blockers**: Mission system integration, save/load system implementation
- **Related Stories**: FLOW-008 (Save Game System), SEXP-007 (Mission Events), OBJ-002 (Object Lifecycle)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create ShipStateManager with comprehensive WCS flag system and state validation
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement ShipLifecycleController for creation, activation, departure, and destruction events
- [ ] **Task 3**: Add state transition management for arrival phases and combat states
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create team and IFF management system with faction relationship tracking
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement combat state tracking with damage accumulation and dying sequences
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add mission system integration for arrival/departure cues and red alert persistence
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create save/load integration for state persistence across mission transitions
- [ ] **Task 8**: Implement signal-based state change notifications for system integration

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - State flag management and validation
  - Lifecycle event sequencing
  - State transition logic
  - Team/IFF relationship calculations
  - Save/load state preservation
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Mission system event handling
  - AI system state synchronization
  - Object system lifecycle coordination
  - Wing formation state tracking
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Ship lifecycle matches WCS behavior exactly
  - State persistence works across save/load
  - Combat states transition correctly

## System Integration Requirements

### Mission System Integration
- **Arrival/Departure**: Mission-scripted ship arrival and departure sequences
- **Event Logging**: Ship lifecycle events recorded for mission scripting
- **Red Alert State**: Persistent ship state across red alert mission transitions
- **Mission Persistence**: Ship flags preserved in mission save data

### Save/Load System Integration  
- **State Persistence**: All ship flags and state data saved to game files
- **Mission Transitions**: Ship state preserved across mission boundaries
- **Damage Tracking**: Comprehensive damage recording for campaign persistence
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and restoration during save/load cycles

### AI System Integration
- **Goal Management**: AI goals synchronized with ship lifecycle states
- **Behavior Coordination**: AI behavior adapts to ship state changes
- **Formation Tracking**: Wing formation membership tied to ship lifecycle
- **Target Management**: AI targeting updates based on ship state and team changes

### Object System Integration
- **Physics Lifecycle**: Ship physics state synchronized with lifecycle events
- **Collision Management**: Collision detection enabled/disabled based on ship state
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper object cleanup during destruction and departure
- **Performance Optimization**: Object pooling and reuse for ship lifecycle management

### Team Management Integration
- **IFF Relationships**: Faction alignment determines combat targeting and behavior
- **Combat Rules**: Team membership affects weapon targeting and damage rules
- **Player Commands**: Team status determines player command availability
- **Mission Objectives**: Team changes affect mission success conditions

### Wing System Integration
- **Formation Membership**: Ship lifecycle affects wing formation participation
- **Group Behaviors**: Wing-level behaviors respond to member ship state changes
- **Command Hierarchy**: Wing leadership changes based on ship lifecycle events
- **Status Tracking**: Wing status reflects individual ship lifecycle states

## Notes and Comments
- State management must be robust to handle complex mission scenarios and edge cases
- Signal architecture critical for real-time state synchronization across systems
- Performance optimization important for large fleet scenarios with many state changes
- Save/load integration must preserve exact WCS state fidelity
