## Story Definition
**As a**: Game developer implementing the WCS-Godot conversion  
**I want**: A comprehensive weapon management and firing system that handles primary/secondary weapons, energy/ammunition tracking, and precise firing mechanics  
**So that**: Ships can engage in authentic WCS-style combat with proper weapon behavior, resource management, and integration with ship systems

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Weapon manager handles primary banks (energy-based) and secondary banks (ammunition-based) with proper configuration and state tracking
- [ ] **AC2**: Firing system implements precise timing control, rate limiting, and burst fire mechanics matching WCS behavior
- [ ] **AC3**: Energy management system integrates weapon firing with ship power systems and energy transfer system (ETS)
- [ ] **AC4**: Ammunition tracking manages missile capacities, rearm processes, and empty bank handling
- [ ] **AC5**: Weapon selection system supports bank cycling, weapon linking, and dual-fire modes with proper validation
- [ ] **AC6**: Target acquisition integrates with AI and player control systems for accurate firing solutions
- [ ] **AC7**: Subsystem integration connects weapon health, turret control, and mounting point management

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-011-ship-combat-systems/architecture.md - Weapon Systems section
- **Godot Components**: Weapon manager nodes, firing controllers, resource tracking systems

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Weapon bank configuration and state management
  - Firing timing and rate limiting accuracy
  - Energy consumption and ammunition tracking
  - Weapon selection and linking logic
  - Turret targeting and firing behavior
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Ship controller weapon system coordination
  - Energy system integration and ETS interaction
  - AI system weapon control and targeting
  - Player control responsiveness and feedback
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Weapon firing matches WCS behavior exactly
  - Energy/ammunition management works correctly
  - Turret systems operate authentically

## System Integration Requirements

### Ship Controller Integration
- **Weapon State Management**: Primary and secondary weapon bank configurations stored in ship data
- **Firing Coordination**: Weapon manager coordinates with ship movement and orientation systems
- **System Health**: Weapon system status affects overall ship combat effectiveness
- **Resource Management**: Weapon systems consume ship energy and ammunition resources

### Energy Transfer System Integration  
- **Power Distribution**: Weapon energy reserves managed through ETS allocation system
- **Consumption Tracking**: Real-time energy consumption during primary weapon firing
- **Regeneration Control**: Weapon energy regeneration rates based on ETS settings
- **Emergency Management**: Low energy warnings and automatic firing restrictions

### Subsystem Manager Integration
- **Health Monitoring**: Weapon subsystem damage affects firing capability and accuracy
- **Turret Control**: Turret subsystems managed as specialized weapon mounting points
- **Repair Integration**: Weapon system repairs restore full firing capability
- **Destruction Handling**: Complete weapon subsystem loss disables affected weapon banks

### AI System Integration
- **Automated Targeting**: AI system provides target selection and prioritization for weapon systems
- **Firing Decisions**: AI determines optimal weapon selection and firing timing
- **Behavioral Coordination**: Weapon usage coordinated with AI behavioral states
- **Difficulty Scaling**: AI weapon accuracy and timing scaled based on difficulty settings

### Player Control Integration
- **Input Processing**: Player firing commands processed through weapon manager
- **HUD Feedback**: Weapon status, ammunition, and energy levels displayed in HUD
- **Selection Control**: Player weapon bank selection and linking mode changes
- **Targeting Integration**: Manual targeting system coordinates with weapon firing solutions

### Audio Manager Integration
- **Firing Sounds**: Weapon discharge audio triggered by firing events
- **Reload Audio**: Ammunition reload and energy recharge sound feedback
- **Warning Alerts**: Low ammunition and energy warning sounds
- **Impact Feedback**: Weapon hit confirmation audio for player feedback

### VFX System Integration
- **Projectile Creation**: Weapon firing creates appropriate projectile objects
- **Muzzle Effects**: Gun point visual effects for weapon discharge
- **Impact Effects**: Weapon hit effects coordinated with damage system

## Notes and Comments
- Weapon timing must precisely replicate WCS millisecond-based firing delays
- Energy/ammunition duality requires careful resource management coordination
- Turret systems need specialized handling for automated targeting and tracking
- Signal-based architecture critical for responsive weapon system integration
