## System Integration Requirements

### Ship Controller Integration
- **Performance Coordination**: Ship controller aggregates subsystem states for overall performance calculation
- **Operational Status**: Subsystem failures affect ship operational capabilities and available actions
- **Emergency Protocols**: Critical subsystem failure triggers ship-wide emergency responses
- **System Dependencies**: Ship controller manages interdependent subsystem relationships

### Damage System Integration
- **Damage Distribution**: Incoming damage distributes to subsystems based on hit location and weapon type
- **Penetration Mechanics**: Armor penetration calculations determine subsystem damage probability
- **Damage Types**: Different damage types (kinetic, energy, explosive) affect subsystems differently
- **Critical Damage**: Subsystem damage can trigger additional cascade effects through damage system

### Weapon Systems Integration
- **Targeted Firing**: Weapon systems can focus fire on specific subsystems for tactical advantage
- **Subsystem Weapons**: Turrets and weapon mounts are subsystems that can be damaged or destroyed
- **Firing Solutions**: Subsystem targeting affects weapon accuracy and damage application
- **Weapon Effectiveness**: Weapon subsystem damage affects firing capability and accuracy

### AI System Integration
- **Tactical Targeting**: AI evaluates subsystem targeting priorities based on tactical situation
- **Repair Prioritization**: AI manages repair resource allocation for optimal combat effectiveness
- **Subsystem Awareness**: AI understands subsystem interdependencies for strategic decision-making
- **Emergency Responses**: AI responds to critical subsystem failures with appropriate behaviors

### HUD System Integration
- **Status Display**: HUD shows real-time subsystem health and operational status
- **Damage Indicators**: Visual indicators clearly communicate subsystem damage states
- **Targeting Interface**: HUD provides subsystem targeting selection for player ships
- **Repair Progress**: Repair mechanics display progress and resource requirements

### Mission System Integration
- **Subsystem Objectives**: Mission objectives can require specific subsystem targeting or preservation
- **Event Triggers**: Subsystem damage states can trigger mission events and story progression
- **Victory Conditions**: Mission success can depend on subsystem integrity and operational status
- **Scripted Damage**: Mission scripts can apply specific subsystem damage for narrative purposes

### Save System Integration
- **State Persistence**: Subsystem damage states persist across save/load cycles accurately
- **Repair Progress**: Ongoing repair operations maintain progress through save/load operations
- **Historical Damage**: Save system tracks cumulative subsystem damage for progression
- **Configuration Preservation**: Subsystem configurations and modifications persist correctly

## WCS Subsystem Damage Thresholds (from subsysdamage.h)

### Engine Subsystems
- **Full Speed Threshold**: 50% strength minimum for full speed operation
- **Warp Capability**: 30% strength required to engage warp drive
- **Minimum Contribution**: 15% strength minimum for any speed contribution

### Weapon Subsystems
- **Reliable Firing**: 70% strength or better for consistent weapon operation
- **Firing Failure**: Below 20% strength weapons become unreliable/non-functional
- **Progressive Degradation**: 20-70% range provides probabilistic firing success

### Sensor Subsystems
- **Targeting Systems**: 30% strength minimum for full targeting capability
- **Radar Operations**: 40% strength minimum for full radar functionality
- **Minimum Function**: 20% targeting, 10% radar for basic operation

### Shield Subsystems
- **Full Effectiveness**: 50% strength minimum for full shield protection
- **Shield Flickering**: Below 30% strength shields become intermittent
- **Shield Failure**: Complete failure below critical thresholds

### Communication Systems
- **Squadmate Messaging**: 30% strength minimum for communication capability
- **Status Levels**: Destroyed (0%), Damaged (1), Operational (2)

### Navigation Systems
- **Warp Navigation**: 30% strength minimum for warp drive operation
- **Course Plotting**: Navigation damage affects jump accuracy and capability

## Notes and Comments
- Subsystem damage thresholds must precisely match WCS values for authentic behavior
- Performance degradation curves should provide clear tactical feedback
- Repair mechanics need balancing to maintain tactical depth without frustration
- Visual feedback critical for player understanding of subsystem states
- AI subsystem targeting must demonstrate intelligent tactical decision-making
