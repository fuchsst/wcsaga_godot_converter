# User Story: Ship Controller and Base Ship Systems

**Epic**: EPIC-011: Ship & Combat Systems  
**Story ID**: SHIP-001  
**Created**: 2025-06-08  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game developer implementing the WCS-Godot conversion  
**I want**: A foundational ship controller system that manages core ship behaviors, state, and lifecycle  
**So that**: All ships in the game can be instantiated, controlled, and managed with authentic WCS-like behavior as the foundation for the combat system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: BaseShip class extends BaseSpaceObject with WCS-authentic ship properties (hull, shields, mass, velocity limits)
- [ ] **AC2**: Ship initialization properly configures physics properties, subsystems, and weapon banks from ship class definitions
- [ ] **AC3**: Ship lifecycle management includes proper creation, configuration, cleanup, and destruction sequences
- [ ] **AC4**: Core ship state management handles flags, team alignment, energy systems, and frame-by-frame updates
- [ ] **AC5**: Ship physics integration maintains WCS movement characteristics (acceleration, damping, afterburner behavior)
- [ ] **AC6**: Energy Transfer System (ETS) manages power allocation between shields, weapons, and engines
- [ ] **AC7**: Ship controller processes subsystem states and applies performance effects (engine damage affects speed)

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-011-ship-combat-systems/architecture.md - Ship Foundation section
- **Godot Components**: BaseSpaceObject extension, ShipClass resource, ship controller scene structure
- **Integration Points**: Object system (EPIC-009), Asset structures (EPIC-002), Physics system (Godot RigidBody3D)

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: source/code/ship/ship.cpp, source/code/ship/ship.h - Core ship structures and lifecycle
- **Godot Approach**: Use RigidBody3D for physics, signals for subsystem communication, resources for ship definitions
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining WCS physics feel while leveraging Godot's physics system
- **Success Metrics**: Ships move and behave identically to WCS, ETS affects performance realistically

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-009 BaseSpaceObject system completed
- **Blockers**: Ship class definitions from EPIC-002 asset structures
- **Related Stories**: SHIP-002 (Subsystem Management), SHIP-003 (Ship Class Definitions)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create BaseShip class extending BaseSpaceObject with core ship properties
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement ship physics integration (mass, velocity limits, acceleration, damping)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create ship lifecycle methods (initialization, configuration, cleanup, destruction)
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement Energy Transfer System (ETS) for power allocation management
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add core ship state management (flags, team, health, energy systems)
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create ship frame processing loop with pre/post processing phases
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement subsystem state monitoring and performance effects
- [ ] **Task 8**: Add ship control interfaces (movement, afterburner, system management)

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Ship creation and initialization
  - ETS power allocation calculations
  - Physics property configuration
  - State flag management
  - Lifecycle completion
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Ship-object system interaction
  - Physics system integration
  - Signal communication with subsystems
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Ship movement feels like WCS
  - ETS affects ship performance correctly
  - Subsystem damage impacts behavior

## Notes and Comments
- BaseShip must maintain WCS physics characteristics while leveraging Godot's RigidBody3D
- ETS implementation should be data-driven to allow balance adjustments
- Signals should be used extensively for subsystem communication
- State management must be robust to handle complex ship conditions
