# User Story: Ship Class Definitions and Factory System

**Epic**: EPIC-011: Ship & Combat Systems  
**Story ID**: SHIP-003  
**Created**: 2025-06-08  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game developer implementing the WCS-Godot conversion  
**I want**: A comprehensive ship class definition system and factory for creating configured ship instances  
**So that**: Ships can be spawned with authentic WCS characteristics, loadouts, and capabilities using data-driven definitions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: ShipClass resource defines all WCS ship characteristics (physics, weapons, subsystems, AI) from ships.tbl data
- [ ] **AC2**: ShipTemplate resource handles ship variants and loadout configurations with inheritance support
- [ ] **AC3**: ShipFactory creates properly configured ship instances from class definitions and templates
- [ ] **AC4**: ShipRegistry provides efficient lookup and management of ship class definitions
- [ ] **AC5**: Factory system integrates with asset management for 3D models, textures, and weapon configurations
- [ ] **AC6**: Ship spawning process handles proper physics initialization, subsystem setup, and AI assignment
- [ ] **AC7**: Template system supports ship variants using WCS naming conventions (e.g., "GTF Apollo#Advanced")

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-011-ship-combat-systems/architecture.md - Ship Templates and Classes section
- **Godot Components**: Resource classes (ShipClass, ShipTemplate), factory singleton, registry management
- **Integration Points**: 
  - **WCS Asset Core**: Ship definitions from ships.tbl, 3D model associations, texture management
  - **Asset Management System**: Model loading, weapon hardpoint configuration, subsystem placement
  - **Object System**: BaseSpaceObject instantiation and lifecycle management
  - **AI System**: AI personality assignment and behavior configuration
  - **Mission System**: Ship spawning from mission files and SEXP commands

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: source/code/ship/ship.cpp (ship creation), source/code/parse/parselo.cpp (ships.tbl parsing)
- **Godot Approach**: Resource-based definitions with factory singleton pattern, leveraging Godot's resource loading
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining WCS ship variant inheritance while using Godot resource system efficiently
- **Success Metrics**: Any WCS ship can be spawned with identical characteristics and behavior to the original

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: SHIP-001 (BaseShip), EPIC-002 asset management system for ship definitions
- **Blockers**: Ship definition data migration from WCS tables, 3D model import pipeline
- **Related Stories**: SHIP-002 (Subsystem Management), ASM-005 (Ship Data Resources), DM-008 (Asset Table Processing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create ShipClass resource with all WCS ship characteristics (physics, weapons, subsystems)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement ShipTemplate resource for loadout configurations and ship variants
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create ShipRegistry singleton for efficient ship class lookup and management
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement ShipFactory with ship creation and configuration methods
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add ship variant inheritance system supporting WCS naming conventions
- [ ] **Task 6**: Integrate with asset management for model, texture, and weapon loading
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement ship spawning pipeline with physics, subsystems, and AI setup
- [ ] **Task 8**: Add validation and error handling for ship definition integrity

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Ship class definition loading and validation
  - Ship template inheritance and variant resolution
  - Factory creation methods with different configurations
  - Registry lookup performance and accuracy
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Asset system integration for models and weapons
  - Complete ship spawning pipeline validation
  - AI and subsystem configuration verification
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Spawned ships match WCS specifications exactly
  - Ship variants inherit properties correctly
  - Factory handles all WCS ship types

## System Integration Requirements

### WCS Asset Core Integration
- **Ship Definitions**: Load ships.tbl data into ShipClass resources with full WCS compatibility
- **Model Associations**: 3D model files, hardpoint configurations, subsystem placement data
- **Texture Management**: Ship textures, team colors, damage states, and material definitions

### Asset Management System Integration  
- **Resource Loading**: Efficient ship class resource loading with caching and preloading
- **Model Pipeline**: 3D model import, collision mesh generation, hardpoint validation
- **Weapon Integration**: Weapon hardpoint configuration, ammunition types, convergence settings

### Object System Integration
- **BaseSpaceObject**: Ship instances as specialized space objects with proper physics integration
- **Lifecycle Management**: Ship creation, activation, deactivation, and cleanup processes
- **Collision System**: Ship collision shapes, damage zones, and interaction boundaries

### AI System Integration
- **AI Personality**: Ship-specific AI behavior configuration and personality assignment
- **Behavior Trees**: AI behavior selection based on ship class and role
- **Combat AI**: Ship-specific combat patterns, weapon preferences, and tactical behaviors

### Mission System Integration
- **Mission Spawning**: Create ships from mission files with specific configurations
- **SEXP Integration**: Ship factory access from mission scripting for dynamic spawning
- **Dynamic Creation**: Runtime ship spawning based on mission events and conditions

## Notes and Comments
- ShipClass resources should be preloaded for performance in large battles
- Factory pattern allows for ship pooling and reuse for memory efficiency
- Ship variant system must handle complex inheritance chains from WCS
- Template validation critical to prevent invalid ship configurations
