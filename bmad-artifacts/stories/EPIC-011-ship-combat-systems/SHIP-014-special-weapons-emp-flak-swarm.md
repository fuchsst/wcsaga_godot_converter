## WCS Special Weapon Specifications

### EMP Weapon Mechanics
- **Effect Duration**: 10-30 seconds based on weapon intensity and ship resistance
- **Range Scaling**: Inner radius (full effect) to outer radius (linear scaling)
- **System Effects**: Target lock loss, HUD corruption, AI behavior disruption
- **Ship Immunity**: Capital ships resist EMP to turrets only, fighters fully affected
- **Intensity Decay**: Linear decay over time with progressive system recovery

### Flak Weapon Mechanics
- **Detonation Range**: Predetermined distance calculation with weapon system damage scaling
- **Aim Jitter**: Cone of inaccuracy increases with weapon subsystem damage
- **Area Coverage**: 60-meter default detonation variance for defensive barriers
- **Muzzle Limiting**: Muzzle flash effects limited to prevent visual overflow
- **Safety Range**: Minimum 10-meter detonation distance for safety

### Swarm Weapon Mechanics
- **Launch Sequence**: 4 missiles fired sequentially with weapon-specific timing delays
- **Flight Patterns**: 4 distinct spiral patterns (vertical, horizontal, two diagonal)
- **Spiral Math**: Trigonometric calculations for evasive flight paths
- **Target Tracking**: Initial spiral phase followed by direct approach when close
- **Coordination**: Turret and ship-mounted swarm systems manage firing timing

### Area Effect Calculations
- **Range Formula**: `scale_factor = 1.0f - (distance / outer_radius)`
- **Damage Scaling**: Linear interpolation between inner and outer radius effectiveness
- **Resistance Modifier**: Ship-specific EMP resistance reduces effect intensity
- **Minimum Effect**: Effects below threshold ignored for performance optimization

## Notes and Comments
- EMP HUD disruption must be implemented as custom CanvasLayer effects
- Swarm spiral mathematics require precise trigonometric calculations
- Flak detonation timing critical for tactical area denial effectiveness
- Special weapon visual effects need distinctive impact and recognition
- Performance optimization essential for multiple simultaneous special weapons
