- **Characteristics**: High damage, long range, requires large mount
- **Collision**: Precision line collision with penetration through large ships

### Type B: Slash Beam
- **Behavior**: Sweeps across target using octant selection for area coverage
- **Usage**: Anti-fighter point defense, area denial weapons
- **Characteristics**: Wide area effect, moderate damage, sweeping motion
- **Collision**: Sphereline collision for area effect damage

### Type C: Targeting Laser
- **Behavior**: Fighter-mounted forward beam, lives for single frame
- **Usage**: Fighter primary weapons, small ship armament
- **Characteristics**: Low power, continuous operation, precise targeting
- **Collision**: Line collision with high precision for fighter combat

### Type D: Chasing Beam
- **Behavior**: Multiple shots tracking moving targets with dynamic aim adjustment
- **Usage**: Anti-fighter tracking weapons, point defense systems
- **Characteristics**: Target tracking, multiple attempts, moderate damage
- **Collision**: Sequential collision checks with target prediction

### Type E: Fixed Beam
- **Behavior**: Fires directly from turret orientation without aiming
- **Usage**: Defensive barriers, fixed emplacements, special weapons
- **Characteristics**: No tracking, fixed direction, area control
- **Collision**: Line collision from turret orientation

## Notes and Comments
- Beam collision detection must handle both thin precision beams and wide area effect beams
- Continuous damage timing critical for authentic WCS feel (170ms intervals)
- Beam visual effects need multi-section rendering for proper appearance
- Performance optimization essential for multiple simultaneous beam weapons
- Type-specific movement algorithms must precisely match WCS behavior
