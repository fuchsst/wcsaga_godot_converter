# User Story: Statistics and Progression Tracking

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-006  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: Detailed statistics and progression tracking that shows my combat performance, medals, and achievements  
**So that**: I can monitor my progress and see how my piloting skills have improved throughout campaigns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Statistics display shows flight time, missions flown, kills, and scoring data
- [ ] **AC2**: Medal and achievement system with visual display and earned medal tracking
- [ ] **AC3**: Rank progression display with requirements and advancement tracking
- [ ] **AC4**: Combat effectiveness metrics including accuracy, survival rate, and performance ratings
- [ ] **AC5**: Historical tracking with mission-by-mission breakdown and trend analysis
- [ ] **AC6**: Export/import functionality for statistics sharing and backup

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - PilotProfileData statistics and progression sections
- **Godot Components**: Resource-based statistics storage, data visualization, export systems
- **Integration Points**: PilotProfileData, mission completion system, achievement framework

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/stats/stats.cpp`, `medals.cpp` - statistics and medal systems
- **Godot Approach**: Resource-based statistics with calculated metrics and progression tracking
- **Key Challenges**: Performance calculations, accurate statistics tracking, data visualization
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS statistics implemented, accurate tracking, proper medal system

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - MENU-004 (pilot management system)
  - MENU-003 (shared UI components)
  - PilotProfileData implementation
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-005 (campaign progress), mission system integration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Extend PilotProfileData with comprehensive statistics tracking
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create pilot_statistics.tscn scene with data visualization components
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement ProgressionTracker class for rank advancement and requirements
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build medal system with display, requirements, and award tracking
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add combat effectiveness calculations and performance metrics
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create historical tracking with mission breakdown and trend analysis
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement statistics export/import for backup and sharing

## Testing Strategy
