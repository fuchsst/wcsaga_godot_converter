# User Story: Graphics and Performance Options

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-010  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: Comprehensive graphics and performance settings that allow me to optimize the game for my system  
**So that**: I can achieve the best visual quality and performance balance for my hardware configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Graphics options scene with resolution, quality settings, and visual effects controls
- [ ] **AC2**: Performance settings including frame rate limits, V-sync, and optimization options
- [ ] **AC3**: Real-time preview of setting changes with immediate visual feedback
- [ ] **AC4**: Preset configurations for different hardware levels (low, medium, high, ultra)
- [ ] **AC5**: ConfigurationManager integration for persistent settings storage and validation
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance monitoring display showing current FPS, memory usage, and system impact

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - Options and configuration section
- **Godot Components**: Option controls, settings validation, real-time preview, performance monitoring
- **Integration Points**: ConfigurationManager autoload, Godot engine settings, performance monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/menuui/optionsmenu.cpp` - graphics and performance configuration
- **Godot Approach**: Scene-based options with ConfigurationManager integration and real-time feedback
- **Key Challenges**: Real-time preview, performance monitoring, hardware detection
- **Success Metrics**: All settings properly applied, real-time feedback working, persistent storage

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - ConfigurationManager (EPIC-001 completed)
  - MENU-003 (shared UI components)
  - MENU-011 (options framework)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-011 (audio/controls), MENU-012 (settings persistence)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create graphics_options.tscn scene with resolution and quality controls
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement GraphicsOptionsController class with setting management
- [ ] **Task 3**: Add real-time preview system for immediate visual feedback
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create preset configurations for different hardware levels
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate ConfigurationManager for persistent settings storage
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add performance monitoring with FPS, memory, and system impact display
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement hardware detection and automatic recommendation system

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test setting validation, preset configurations, persistence
- **Integration Tests**: Verify ConfigurationManager integration and real-time preview
- **Manual Tests**: Settings application, performance impact, hardware compatibility

## Notes and Comments
This story focuses on technical settings that directly impact game performance. Real-time preview and performance monitoring are essential for user experience.
