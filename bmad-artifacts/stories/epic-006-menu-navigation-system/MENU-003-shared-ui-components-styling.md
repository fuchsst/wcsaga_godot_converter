# User Story: Shared UI Components and Styling

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-003  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: developer implementing menu systems  
**I want**: Reusable UI components with consistent WCS styling and behavior  
**So that**: All menu screens have a unified appearance and common functionality is implemented once

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: MenuButton component with WCS styling (military color scheme, hover effects, focus states)
- [ ] **AC2**: DialogModal component for confirmations, warnings, and information displays
- [ ] **AC3**: LoadingScreen component with progress indicators and background tasks support
- [ ] **AC4**: SettingsPanel component for configuration options with validation
- [ ] **AC5**: UIThemeManager provides consistent styling across all menu components
- [ ] **AC6**: ResponsiveLayout system adapts to different screen resolutions (1280+ and compact modes)

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - UI Design Architecture section
- **Godot Components**: Theme system, Control nodes, StyleBox resources, custom Control classes
- **Integration Points**: All menu scenes, ConfigurationManager for theme persistence

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/menuui/` - UI styling patterns and component behavior
- **Godot Approach**: Scene-based reusable components with controller scripts following GFRED2 pattern
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing authenticity with modern UI patterns and accessibility
- **Success Metrics**: Component reuse across menu system, consistent visual appearance, proper responsive behavior

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Basic Godot UI knowledge
  - ConfigurationManager (completed)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: All other MENU stories will use these components

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create UIThemeManager with WCS color scheme and styling definitions
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement MenuButton component with WCS styling and interaction states
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create DialogModal component with title, message, and button customization
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build LoadingScreen component with progress bar and status text
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement SettingsPanel component with option validation
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create ResponsiveLayout system for different screen sizes
- [ ] **Task 7**: Build MenuAnimations helper for standard component animations

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test component instantiation, styling application, and responsive behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Verify theme consistency across different menu scenes
- **Manual Tests**: Visual validation, accessibility testing, responsive layout testing

## Notes and Comments
These components will be used throughout the menu system, so quality and consistency are critical. The WCS military aesthetic must be preserved while ensuring modern usability.
