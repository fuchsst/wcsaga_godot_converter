# User Story: Settings Persistence and Validation

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-012  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: Reliable settings persistence and validation that ensures my configuration preferences are saved and restored correctly  
**So that**: My game settings are maintained between sessions and I receive helpful feedback when configuration issues occur

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: All menu settings persist correctly using ConfigurationManager with automatic backup
- [ ] **AC2**: Settings validation prevents invalid configurations and provides helpful error messages
- [ ] **AC3**: Configuration corruption detection with automatic fallback to defaults
- [ ] **AC4**: Settings import/export functionality for configuration backup and sharing
- [ ] **AC5**: Real-time validation feedback during settings modification
- [ ] **AC6**: Reset to defaults functionality with confirmation and selective reset options

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - MenuSettingsManager and validation systems
- **Godot Components**: ConfigurationManager integration, validation framework, backup systems
- **Integration Points**: ConfigurationManager autoload, all menu option scenes, error handling

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/menuui/optionsmenu.cpp` - settings persistence and validation
- **Godot Approach**: Resource-based settings with comprehensive validation and backup
- **Key Challenges**: Corruption detection, validation timing, backup management
- **Success Metrics**: 100% settings persistence reliability, comprehensive validation coverage

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - ConfigurationManager (EPIC-001 completed)
  - MENU-010 (graphics options)
  - MENU-011 (audio/control options)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: All other menu configuration stories

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement MenuSettingsData Resource class with full validation
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create MenuSettingsManager class with ConfigurationManager integration
- [ ] **Task 3**: Add settings validation framework with real-time feedback
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement configuration backup and corruption detection
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create settings import/export functionality
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add reset to defaults with confirmation and selective options
- [ ] **Task 7**: Build comprehensive error handling and user feedback system

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test validation logic, persistence operations, corruption handling
- **Integration Tests**: Verify ConfigurationManager integration and cross-system settings
- **Manual Tests**: Settings persistence across sessions, corruption recovery, import/export

## Notes and Comments
This story ensures the reliability of the entire menu system's configuration. Robust validation and backup systems are critical for user experience.
