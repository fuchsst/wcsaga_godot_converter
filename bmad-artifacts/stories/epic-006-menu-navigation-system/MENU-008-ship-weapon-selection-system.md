# User Story: Ship and Weapon Selection System

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-008  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: A ship and weapon selection interface that allows me to choose my spacecraft and customize loadouts  
**So that**: I can select the optimal ship and weapons for each mission based on objectives and personal preference

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Ship selection scene displays available ships with 3D previews and detailed specifications
- [ ] **AC2**: Weapon loadout interface allows primary and secondary weapon customization per mission constraints
- [ ] **AC3**: WCS Asset Core integration for ship and weapon data with real-time validation
- [ ] **AC4**: Loadout validation ensures compatibility with mission requirements and ship capabilities
- [ ] **AC5**: Pilot skill and rank restrictions properly limit available ships and weapons
- [ ] **AC6**: Loadout persistence saves player preferences per pilot and mission type

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - Ship and weapon selection integration
- **Godot Components**: 3D ship preview, weapon configuration UI, asset validation, persistence
- **Integration Points**: WCS Asset Core (ShipData, WeaponData), PilotProfileData, mission constraints

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/missionui/missionshipchoice.cpp` - ship and loadout selection
- **Godot Approach**: Scene-based selection with WCS Asset Core integration and 3D previews
- **Key Challenges**: 3D ship visualization, complex loadout validation, mission constraint enforcement
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS ships/weapons available, proper validation, smooth 3D preview

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - WCS Asset Core (EPIC-002 completed)
  - MENU-004 (pilot management)
  - MENU-007 (mission briefing)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-009 (debriefing), mission system integration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create ship_selection.tscn scene with ship browser and 3D preview viewport
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement weapon_loadout.tscn scene with weapon bank configuration
- [ ] **Task 3**: Build LoadoutManager class for validation and configuration management
- [ ] **Task 4**: Integrate WCS Asset Core for ship and weapon data loading
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add 3D ship preview with rotation, zoom, and detail inspection
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement loadout validation against mission constraints and pilot restrictions
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create loadout persistence system with pilot-specific preferences

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test loadout validation, asset integration, persistence functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Verify WCS Asset Core integration and pilot data coordination
- **Manual Tests**: Ship selection workflow, weapon configuration, 3D preview performance

## Notes and Comments
This story requires solid integration with WCS Asset Core for ship and weapon data. The 3D preview system adds visual complexity but is essential for proper ship selection.
