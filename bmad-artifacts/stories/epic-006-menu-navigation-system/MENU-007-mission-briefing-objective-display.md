# User Story: Mission Briefing and Objective Display

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-007  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: A comprehensive mission briefing interface that displays objectives, background, and tactical information  
**So that**: I understand my mission goals, context, and tactical situation before launching into combat

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Mission briefing scene displays primary and secondary objectives with clear descriptions
- [ ] **AC2**: Tactical map integration showing mission area, waypoints, and enemy positions
- [ ] **AC3**: Background story and context display with narrative elements and character dialogue
- [ ] **AC4**: Ship recommendation system based on mission requirements and pilot skill
- [ ] **AC5**: SEXP integration for dynamic objectives and conditional briefing content
- [ ] **AC6**: Audio briefing support with synchronized voice acting and text display

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - Mission briefing integration section
- **Godot Components**: Rich text display, audio integration, map visualization, SEXP condition evaluation
- **Integration Points**: SEXPManager, mission data system, audio system, ship selection

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/missionui/missionbrief.cpp` - mission briefing presentation
- **Godot Approach**: Scene-based briefing with dynamic content and SEXP integration
- **Key Challenges**: Dynamic content generation, audio synchronization, map visualization
- **Success Metrics**: All briefing content displayed correctly, proper SEXP evaluation, audio sync

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - MENU-003 (shared UI components)
  - SEXPManager (EPIC-004 completed)
  - Mission data structures
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-008 (ship selection), MENU-009 (debriefing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create mission_briefing.tscn scene with layout for objectives and narrative
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement BriefingController class with dynamic content management
- [ ] **Task 3**: Build tactical map visualization with waypoints and enemy markers
- [ ] **Task 4**: Integrate SEXP system for conditional objectives and dynamic content
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add audio briefing support with synchronized playback
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement ship recommendation system based on mission analysis
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create narrative display with character dialogue and story elements

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test content display, SEXP evaluation, audio synchronization
- **Integration Tests**: Verify mission data integration and ship recommendation accuracy
- **Manual Tests**: Briefing presentation flow, audio quality, map visualization

## Notes and Comments
This is a complex story due to the dynamic nature of briefing content and SEXP integration. Audio synchronization and map visualization add additional complexity.
