# User Story: Campaign Selection and Progress Display

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-005  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: A campaign selection interface that shows available campaigns, my progress, and story branching options  
**So that**: I can choose campaigns, track my progression, and understand story branches like the original WCS

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Campaign selection scene displays all available campaigns with descriptions and progress
- [ ] **AC2**: Progress display shows completed missions, current position, and available branches
- [ ] **AC3**: SEXPManager integration for conditional campaign options and story branching
- [ ] **AC4**: Campaign state management with save/load of progression and variable state
- [ ] **AC5**: Support for multiple campaign files and campaign switching
- [ ] **AC6**: Visual progress indicators with mission completion status and medals earned

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - Campaign management and SEXP integration sections
- **Godot Components**: Resource-based campaign data, SEXP integration, progress visualization
- **Integration Points**: SEXPManager (EPIC-004), PilotProfileData, mission system

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/mission/missioncampaign.cpp` - campaign management and progression
- **Godot Approach**: Resource-based campaign definitions with SEXP condition evaluation
- **Key Challenges**: SEXP integration for story branching, complex progression state management
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS campaign features working, proper SEXP condition evaluation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - MENU-004 (pilot management)
  - SEXPManager (EPIC-004 completed)
  - MENU-003 (shared UI components)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-006 (statistics), mission flow stories

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create campaign_selection.tscn scene with campaign browser and preview
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement campaign_progress.tscn scene with mission tree visualization
- [ ] **Task 3**: Build CampaignManager class for campaign state and progression tracking
- [ ] **Task 4**: Integrate MenuSEXPIntegration for conditional options and story branching
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create StoryProgression class for narrative management and cutscene integration
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add campaign switching and multi-campaign support
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement progress visualization with completion indicators and medal display

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test campaign loading, progression tracking, SEXP condition evaluation
- **Integration Tests**: Verify SEXPManager integration and pilot data coordination
- **Manual Tests**: Campaign selection workflow, progression display, branching scenarios

## Notes and Comments
This story requires careful SEXP integration for story branching. The complexity comes from managing campaign state and ensuring proper progression tracking.
