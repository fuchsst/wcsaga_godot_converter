# User Story: Screen Transition System and Effects

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-002  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: Smooth, visually appealing transitions between menu screens that match the original WCS experience  
**So that**: The game feels polished and maintains the authentic WCS atmosphere during navigation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: All menu transitions complete in under 100ms (33% faster than original WCS 150-300ms)
- [ ] **AC2**: Transition effects include fade, dissolve, slide_left, slide_right, and instant modes
- [ ] **AC3**: SceneManager addon integration provides seamless scene changes without custom autoloads
- [ ] **AC4**: Transition overlay system prevents input during transitions and provides visual feedback
- [ ] **AC5**: Memory usage during transitions stays within 20MB overhead limits
- [ ] **AC6**: Audio system coordination ensures music and sound effects transition smoothly

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - MenuSceneHelper and transition system
- **Godot Components**: SceneManager addon, Control overlay, Tween nodes, AnimationPlayer
- **Integration Points**: GameStateManager for state coordination, audio system for sound transitions

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/menuui/mainhallmenu.cpp` - menu transition logic and timing
- **Godot Approach**: Leverage existing SceneManager addon with custom WCS transition types
- **Key Challenges**: Achieving performance targets while maintaining visual quality
- **Success Metrics**: <100ms transitions, <20MB memory overhead, smooth 60fps animation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - MENU-001 (main menu framework)
  - SceneManager addon (available)
  - GameStateManager (completed)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-003 (shared components), all other menu stories

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement MenuSceneHelper class with WCSTransitionType enum
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create transition overlay system using Control and ColorRect
- [ ] **Task 3**: Integrate with SceneManager addon for scene loading
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement fade, dissolve, slide, and instant transition effects
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add transition timing control and performance monitoring
- [ ] **Task 6**: Coordinate with audio system for music/sound transitions
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add memory usage tracking and optimization

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test transition timing, memory usage, and effect implementations
- **Integration Tests**: Verify SceneManager integration and GameStateManager coordination
- **Manual Tests**: Visual transition quality, performance benchmarking, audio coordination

## Notes and Comments
This story is critical for the overall feel of the menu system. Performance targets are aggressive but necessary for modern feel while maintaining WCS authenticity.
