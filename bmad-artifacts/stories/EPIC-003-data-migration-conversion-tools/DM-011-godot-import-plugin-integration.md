# User Story: Godot Import Plugin Integration

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-011  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: Seamless Godot editor integration through custom import plugins that automatically handle WCS asset formats during development  
**So that**: WCS assets can be imported directly into Godot projects with automatic conversion and optimization without requiring separate CLI tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Create VP archive import plugin enabling direct .vp file import with automatic extraction and asset organization within Godot editor
- [ ] **AC2**: Develop POF model import plugin providing native .pof file support with real-time conversion to GLB and material assignment
- [ ] **AC3**: Implement mission import plugin allowing .fs2 file import with scene generation and mission controller script creation
- [ ] **AC4**: Provide editor UI integration with conversion progress dialogs, import settings panels, and asset browser enhancement
- [ ] **AC5**: Support automatic reimport functionality detecting asset changes and updating converted resources with proper dependency tracking
- [ ] **AC6**: Generate import validation feedback showing conversion status, warnings, and errors directly in Godot editor interface

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - Godot Editor Plugin Integration (lines 993-1084) and import plugin structure
- **GDScript Components**: EditorPlugin classes, EditorImportPlugin implementations, UI controls, progress reporting
- **Integration Points**: Uses conversion logic from DM-001 through DM-009, integrates with Godot import system and file browser

## Implementation Notes
- **Godot Reference**: Godot EditorImportPlugin system, EditorPlugin architecture, custom resource import procedures
- **Plugin Architecture**: Separate plugins for each major asset type (VP, POF, Mission) with shared conversion backend
- **Godot Approach**: Native editor integration providing seamless workflow without external tool dependencies
- **Key Challenges**: Editor UI integration, import progress management, error handling within editor context
- **Success Metrics**: Import 50+ assets directly in editor with seamless conversion and immediate usability

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: All conversion components (DM-001 through DM-009) functional, understanding of Godot import system
- **Blockers**: Godot plugin development knowledge, editor integration testing capabilities
- **Related Stories**: Provides editor interface for all previous conversion functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation, Godot conventions)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of import functionality and error handling
- [ ] Integration testing completed with plugins functional in Godot editor
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including plugin installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Feature validated by importing various WCS assets directly in Godot editor

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days (building on existing conversion logic, focused on Godot integration)
- **Risk Level**: Low (leveraging established conversion components with clear Godot plugin patterns)
- **Confidence**: High (well-documented Godot plugin system and existing conversion foundation)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create VP archive import plugin with extraction and organization functionality
- [ ] **Task 2**: Develop POF model import plugin with real-time conversion and material handling
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement mission file import plugin with scene generation and script creation
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build editor UI integration with progress dialogs and settings panels
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add automatic reimport system with dependency tracking and change detection
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create validation feedback system with editor-integrated error reporting

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Import plugin functionality, conversion accuracy, error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Editor plugin integration, import workflow verification
- **Manual Tests**: User experience in Godot editor, import performance testing, UI responsiveness

## Notes and Comments
Godot import plugins provide the most user-friendly way to work with WCS assets during development. Focus on seamless integration and clear feedback to developers. The plugins should feel native to Godot while providing powerful WCS asset conversion capabilities.
