# User Story: Configuration Migration

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-009  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Completed âœ… - QA Approved

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: A configuration migration system that converts WCS configuration files and player settings into Godot-compatible format  
**So that**: Player preferences, game settings, and configuration data are preserved and accessible in the converted Godot implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: Parse WCS configuration files extracting graphics settings, audio preferences, control bindings, and gameplay options with complete preservation
- [x] **AC2**: Convert configuration data to Godot project settings format maintaining setting categories, value types, and default configurations
- [x] **AC3**: Migrate player profile data including pilot information, campaign progress, and customization settings to Godot save system format
- [x] **AC4**: Transform control bindings and input mappings to Godot InputMap format preserving all key assignments and controller configurations
- [x] **AC5**: Generate Godot-compatible configuration files with proper validation, type checking, and backward compatibility support
- [x] **AC6**: Create migration validation reports documenting setting preservation, conversion accuracy, and any unsupported configuration options

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - config_migrator.py component (referenced in structure but not detailed)
- **Python Components**: Configuration parser, settings converter, profile migrator, InputMap generator, validation system
- **Integration Points**: Integrates with Godot project settings, connects to EPIC-001 configuration management, works with player data systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/cmdline/cmdline.cpp`, `source/code/osapi/osregistry.cpp` for configuration handling and storage
- **Configuration Types**: Graphics settings, audio preferences, control bindings, pilot profiles, campaign saves
- **Godot Approach**: Use Godot's project.godot settings and ConfigFile system for configuration management
- **Key Challenges**: Input mapping conversion, graphics setting adaptation, maintaining player data integrity
- **Success Metrics**: Migrate 50+ configuration options with 95%+ setting preservation and functional input mapping

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of WCS configuration format, Godot settings system knowledge
- **Blockers**: Access to WCS configuration files and player data, Godot InputMap specification
- **Related Stories**: Coordinates with EPIC-001 configuration management for runtime settings access

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of config parsing, setting conversion, and validation
- [ ] Integration testing completed with migrated settings functional in Godot
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including configuration mapping reference and migration procedures
- [ ] Feature validated by verifying migrated settings work correctly in converted game

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days (configuration data processing, settings format conversion, input mapping)
- **Risk Level**: Low (well-defined configuration formats and clear target system)
- **Confidence**: High (straightforward data migration with established patterns)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement WCS configuration file parser extracting all setting categories and values
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create settings converter mapping WCS options to Godot project settings format
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop player profile migrator preserving pilot data and campaign progress
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build InputMap converter transforming control bindings to Godot input system
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement validation system ensuring configuration accuracy and completeness
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create migration report generator documenting conversion results and compatibility

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Configuration parsing accuracy, settings conversion correctness, input mapping validation
- **Integration Tests**: Migrated settings functionality in Godot, input system verification
- **Manual Tests**: Settings preservation verification, control binding functionality, player data integrity

## Notes and Comments
Configuration migration ensures a smooth transition for existing WCS players by preserving their preferences and settings. Focus on maintaining input mapping accuracy as this directly affects gameplay experience. Player data preservation is critical for campaign continuity.
