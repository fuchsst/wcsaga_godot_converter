# User Story: LOD and Material Processing

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-006  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: Advanced LOD (Level of Detail) and material processing that optimizes converted 3D models for performance while maintaining visual quality  
**So that**: Converted WCS models integrate seamlessly with Godot's rendering pipeline and provide optimal performance across different hardware configurations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Process POF LOD hierarchies creating multiple mesh versions with appropriate detail levels for different viewing distances
- [ ] **AC2**: Generate Godot-optimized materials with proper shader assignment, texture mapping, and rendering properties based on WCS material specifications
- [ ] **AC3**: Implement collision mesh generation creating simplified collision geometry for physics interaction while preserving gameplay accuracy
- [ ] **AC4**: Create material property mapping converting WCS glow effects, transparency, and special rendering modes to Godot shader equivalents
- [ ] **AC5**: Generate performance-optimized mesh variants with vertex reduction, texture optimization, and efficient UV mapping for mobile/web targets
- [ ] **AC6**: Produce material validation reports ensuring converted materials maintain visual accuracy and performance characteristics

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - POFModelConverter material processing (lines 368-409) and optimization features
- **Python Components**: LOD processor, material converter, collision mesh generator, shader mapper, optimization tools
- **Integration Points**: Extends DM-005 mesh conversion, integrates with Godot rendering system, outputs to EPIC-002 asset management

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/graphics/gropengl.cpp` for material rendering and LOD management implementation
- **LOD Strategy**: Convert POF detail levels to Godot LOD nodes with automatic distance-based switching
- **Godot Approach**: Use Godot's built-in material system with custom shaders for WCS-specific effects
- **Key Challenges**: Material property mapping accuracy, LOD distance calibration, collision mesh optimization
- **Success Metrics**: Achieve 30%+ performance improvement through LOD optimization while maintaining 95%+ visual fidelity

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: DM-005 (POF to Godot Mesh Conversion) completed with basic GLB models available
- **Blockers**: Understanding of WCS material system, Godot shader knowledge for effect mapping
- **Related Stories**: Integrates with EPIC-008 (Graphics Rendering Engine) for optimal material compatibility

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of LOD generation, material conversion, and optimization
- [ ] Integration testing completed with optimized models performing correctly in Godot
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including material mapping reference and optimization guidelines
- [ ] Feature validated through performance testing and visual quality assessment

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days (building on existing conversion pipeline, focused optimization work)
- **Risk Level**: Low (incremental improvements to established conversion process)
- **Confidence**: High (clear optimization targets and well-understood Godot material system)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement LOD hierarchy processor creating multiple detail levels with proper distance thresholds
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create material property converter mapping WCS materials to Godot equivalents
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop collision mesh generator creating optimized physics geometry
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build shader mapper for WCS-specific effects (glow, transparency, special modes)
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement mesh optimization tools for performance-critical scenarios
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create validation system measuring performance impact and visual quality retention

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: LOD distance calculations, material property mapping, collision mesh accuracy
- **Integration Tests**: Performance testing with optimized models, visual quality verification
- **Manual Tests**: LOD switching verification, material effect accuracy, collision testing

## Notes and Comments
This story focuses on optimization and polish for the 3D model conversion pipeline. The LOD and material processing ensures converted models perform well in real gameplay scenarios while maintaining the visual quality that makes WCS distinctive.
