# User Story: POF to Godot Mesh Conversion

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-005  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: A robust conversion pipeline that transforms parsed POF model data into Godot GLB mesh files with materials and proper scene hierarchy  
**So that**: WCS 3D models can be imported and used seamlessly in the Godot engine while maintaining visual fidelity and gameplay functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Convert parsed POF geometry data to intermediate OBJ format with proper vertex ordering, UV mapping, and normal preservation
- [ ] **AC2**: Generate material files (MTL) with texture references and material properties mapped from WCS specifications to Godot-compatible formats
- [ ] **AC3**: Use Blender automation to convert OBJ+MTL to GLB format preserving mesh hierarchy, materials, and texture assignments
- [ ] **AC4**: Create Godot .import files with optimized settings for ship models including collision generation, LOD configuration, and material setup
- [ ] **AC5**: Preserve subsystem hierarchy and special points as Godot node structure enabling gameplay functionality integration
- [ ] **AC6**: Generate conversion validation reports comparing original POF properties with converted GLB ensuring data integrity and visual accuracy

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - POFModelConverter.convert_pof_to_glb() (lines 303-366) and Blender integration (lines 411-466)
- **Python Components**: OBJ file writer, MTL material generator, Blender Python script automation, GLB validation
- **Integration Points**: Uses DM-004 parsed POF data, integrates with DM-002 texture assets, outputs to Godot project structure

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/model/modelinterp.cpp` for model rendering and material application logic
- **Blender Integration**: Automated Blender pipeline converting OBJ to GLB with material preservation and optimization
- **Godot Approach**: Generate GLB files with proper .import settings enabling seamless Godot editor integration
- **Key Challenges**: Material mapping accuracy, subsystem hierarchy preservation, Blender automation reliability
- **Success Metrics**: Convert 50+ ship models with 95%+ visual fidelity and successful Godot import with materials intact

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: DM-004 (POF Format Analysis and Parser) completed with parsed model data available
- **Blockers**: Blender installation and automation capabilities, texture assets from DM-002 conversion
- **Related Stories**: DM-006 (LOD and Material Processing) extends this conversion with advanced features

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of OBJ generation, material mapping, and GLB validation
- [ ] Integration testing completed with converted models loading successfully in Godot
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including conversion pipeline and troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Feature validated by visual comparison of converted models with original WCS models

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days (multi-stage conversion pipeline, Blender integration, material mapping complexity)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (dependent on Blender automation reliability and material mapping accuracy)
- **Confidence**: High (well-documented conversion pipeline and clear architecture design)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement OBJ file generator converting parsed POF geometry to standard OBJ format
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create MTL material file generator mapping WCS materials to Blender-compatible format
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop Blender automation scripts for OBJ to GLB conversion with material preservation
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build Godot .import file generator with optimized settings for ship models
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement subsystem hierarchy preservation creating proper Godot node structure
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create validation system comparing converted models with original specifications

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: OBJ/MTL file generation accuracy, Blender script execution, GLB format validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end POF to GLB conversion with Godot import verification
- **Manual Tests**: Visual comparison of converted models, material accuracy verification, performance testing

## Notes and Comments
This story represents the core 3D model conversion functionality. Focus on maintaining visual fidelity while ensuring compatibility with Godot's rendering pipeline. The Blender automation should be robust with proper error handling for production use.
