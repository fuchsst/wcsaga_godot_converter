# User Story: VP Archive Extraction System

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-001  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: A robust Python-based VP archive extraction system that can parse and extract all files from WCS VP (Virtual Pack) archives  
**So that**: I can access the compressed assets stored in VP files and make them available for further conversion processing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Successfully parse VP file headers including signature verification, version detection, directory offset, and file count extraction
- [ ] **AC2**: Extract all files from VP archives maintaining original directory structure and file names with 100% data integrity
- [ ] **AC3**: Handle compressed VP archives using the WCS decompression algorithm with support for files ranging from 1KB to 50MB+
- [ ] **AC4**: Process batch VP extraction with progress reporting, error handling, and detailed logging of extraction results
- [ ] **AC5**: Generate extraction metadata including file counts, directory structure, and validation checksums for verification
- [ ] **AC6**: Support resume capability for interrupted extractions and skip already extracted files to enable incremental processing

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - VPArchiveExtractor class (lines 214-290)
- **Python Components**: VPArchiveExtractor class, struct-based binary parsing, file I/O operations, directory management
- **Integration Points**: Feeds extracted assets into texture converter, POF model converter, and mission file converter

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/cfile/cfilearchive.cpp` - VP archive implementation and format specification
- **VP Format Details**: 36-byte header with "VPVP" signature, directory entries table, compressed file data blocks
- **Godot Approach**: Pure Python implementation generating organized file structure for subsequent Godot import processing
- **Key Challenges**: Binary format parsing, handling various VP archive versions, memory efficiency for large archives
- **Success Metrics**: Extract 100+ files from standard WCS VP archives in under 30 seconds with zero data corruption

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Python development environment with struct and pathlib modules
- **Blockers**: Access to WCS VP archive files and format documentation
- **Related Stories**: DM-002 (VP to Godot Resource Conversion) depends on this extraction capability

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of header parsing, file extraction, and error conditions
- [ ] Integration testing completed with actual WCS VP archives
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including format specification and usage examples
- [ ] Feature validated against WCS cfilearchive.cpp extraction behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days (binary format parsing complexity, comprehensive testing requirements)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (dependent on VP format reverse engineering accuracy)
- **Confidence**: High (WCS source code provides exact implementation reference)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement VP header parsing with signature validation and directory offset extraction
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create directory entry parser for file metadata (name, size, offset, timestamp)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement file extraction engine with data integrity verification
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add progress reporting, logging, and comprehensive error handling
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create batch processing capabilities with resume functionality
- [ ] **Task 6**: Develop validation system for extracted file verification

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: VP header parsing, directory entry extraction, individual file extraction, error condition handling
- **Integration Tests**: Full VP archive extraction with verification against known good extractions
- **Manual Tests**: Performance testing with large VP archives (100MB+), edge case testing with corrupted archives

## Notes and Comments
The VP archive format is well-documented in the WCS source code, providing a reliable reference for implementation. Focus on robust error handling since VP files may have various versions or corruption issues. The extraction system forms the foundation for all subsequent asset conversion processes.
