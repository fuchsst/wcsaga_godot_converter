# User Story: POF Format Analysis and Parser

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-004  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: A comprehensive POF (Parallax Object Format) file parser that can extract geometry, materials, and metadata from WCS 3D model files  
**So that**: WCS ship and object models can be accurately converted to Godot-compatible formats while preserving all visual and structural details

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Parse POF file headers and chunk structure extracting version information, object properties, and chunk directory with proper validation
- [ ] **AC2**: Extract geometry data including vertices, faces, normals, and texture coordinates from OBJ2 chunks with full precision preservation
- [ ] **AC3**: Process texture references from TXTR chunks mapping material names to texture file paths with proper path resolution
- [ ] **AC4**: Parse special object data including subsystem definitions, collision meshes, hardpoints, and LOD (Level of Detail) hierarchies
- [ ] **AC5**: Extract metadata including object name, properties, dimensions, mass data, and WCS-specific attributes for asset cataloging
- [ ] **AC6**: Generate intermediate data structure suitable for GLB conversion preserving all parsed information with proper data validation

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - POFModelConverter._parse_pof_file() (lines 334-366)
- **Python Components**: Binary file parser, chunk reader, geometry data structures, material mappers, validation systems
- **Integration Points**: Outputs to DM-005 (POF to Godot Mesh Conversion), integrates with texture mapping from DM-002

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/model/modelread.cpp` - Complete POF format implementation and chunk definitions
- **POF Format Chunks**: TXTR (textures), OBJ2 (geometry), SPCL (special points), PATH (collision paths), INSG (insignia)
- **Godot Approach**: Extract to intermediate format suitable for Blender/GLB conversion pipeline preserving all mesh hierarchy
- **Key Challenges**: Complex chunk-based binary format, hierarchical subsystem structures, material reference resolution
- **Success Metrics**: Parse 100+ POF models with 100% geometry accuracy and complete material/subsystem preservation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Access to WCS POF model files, understanding of POF format specification from modelread.cpp
- **Blockers**: Binary format documentation, sample POF files for testing and validation
- **Related Stories**: DM-005 (POF to Godot Mesh Conversion) depends on this parser output, DM-002 provides texture assets

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of chunk parsing, geometry extraction, and data validation
- [ ] Integration testing completed with various POF model types (ships, stations, debris)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including POF format specification and parser API
- [ ] Feature validated by comparing extracted data with WCS model viewer output

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days (binary format complexity, multiple chunk types, comprehensive geometry handling)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (dependent on POF format reverse engineering and chunk structure understanding)
- **Confidence**: High (WCS source code provides complete implementation reference)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement POF file header parser with signature validation and chunk directory reading
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create chunk reader system supporting all POF chunk types with proper data extraction
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop geometry parser for OBJ2 chunks extracting vertices, faces, normals, and UV coordinates
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build texture reference parser for TXTR chunks with material name mapping
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement subsystem and special point parsers for gameplay-relevant model data
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create validation system ensuring parsed data integrity and completeness

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Chunk parsing accuracy, geometry data extraction, material reference validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end POF parsing with verification against known model properties
- **Manual Tests**: Visual verification of parsed geometry data, comparison with WCS model viewer

## Notes and Comments
POF format is well-documented in modelread.cpp, providing exact implementation reference. Focus on preserving all model data including subsystems and special points that are critical for gameplay functionality. The parser output becomes the foundation for all 3D model conversion work.
