## 1. Executive Summary
This review covers the initial implementation state of the GFRED2 Mission Editor, focusing on three foundational user stories. The review reveals a consistent and critical pattern of deviation from the approved architecture. The current implementation is largely non-functional and requires significant rework to align with the project's architectural principles, particularly regarding SEXP integration and resource-based file I/O. The codebase contains a mix of placeholder code, legacy implementations, and direct violations of the architectural guidelines laid out in the EPIC-005 architecture document.

## 2. Adherence to Story Requirements & Acceptance Criteria

### GFRED2-002: SEXP System Integration
- **Overall Story Goal Fulfillment**: **Not Met**. The core goal of integrating the EPIC-004 SEXP system has failed. The editor uses a custom, non-functional placeholder.
- **Acceptance Criteria Checklist**:
  - [ ] AC1: "GFRED2 SEXP editor uses `addons/sexp/` system" - **Status**: Not Met - **Comments**: The editor uses a local, hardcoded implementation in `addons/gfred2/sexp_editor/`.
  - [ ] AC2: "Visual SEXP editing provides access to all EPIC-004 functions" - **Status**: Not Met - **Comments**: The function list is hardcoded and not populated from the `SexpFunctionRegistry`.
  - [ ] AC3: "SEXP validation and debugging tools are available" - **Status**: Not Met - **Comments**: The underlying logic is a stub, making validation and debugging impossible.

### GFRED2-003: Mission Resource Loading and Saving
- **Overall Story Goal Fulfillment**: **Not Met**. The goal was to abstract GFRED2 to work only with Godot's `.tres` resources. The implementation does the opposite, tying it directly to legacy `.fs2` files.
- **Acceptance Criteria Checklist**:
  - [ ] AC1: "Open Mission" dialog loads `.tres` files - **Status**: Not Met - **Comments**: The dialog is hardcoded to look for and parse `.fs2` files.
  - [ ] AC2: "Save Mission" dialog saves `.tres` file - **Status**: Partially Met - **Comments**: It *can* save a `.tres` file, but its primary UI and logic are focused on exporting back to `.fs2`.
  - [ ] AC3: `MissionFileIO` is used for all operations - **Status**: Not Met - **Comments**: The dialogs do not use `MissionFileIO`; they use the `MissionConverter` or `ResourceSaver` directly.
  - [ ] AC7: Workflow aligned with EPIC-003 - **Status**: Not Met - **Comments**: The workflow is inverted. GFRED2 is acting as a converter instead of an editor for already-converted resources.

### GFRED2-004: Core Infrastructure Integration
- **Overall Story Goal Fulfillment**: **Not Met**. Based on the specific failure to remove the legacy `InputManager`, and the systemic issues in other stories, it's clear a systematic integration of core utilities has not been performed.
- **Acceptance Criteria Checklist**:
  - [ ] AC7: "All custom utility functions removed or migrated" - **Status**: Not Met - **Comments**: `input_manager.gd` is a clear example of a custom utility that was not removed.
  - [ ] AC9: "legacy `input_manager.gd` is removed" - **Status**: Not Met - **Comments**: The file `input_manager.gd` still exists in the codebase.

## 3. Architectural Review (Godot Architect Focus)
- **Adherence to Approved Architecture**: **CRITICAL DEVIATION**. The implementation systematically ignores the core architectural pillars defined in the EPIC-005 architecture document. Specifically, the principles of resource-based data and integration with core systems are violated.
- **Godot Best Practices & Patterns**: The code follows some basic GDScript standards, but the architectural patterns are incorrect. The file I/O logic, in particular, is an anti-pattern that tightly couples the editor to a legacy format.
- **Scene/Node Structure & Composition**: While the UI is scene-based, the scripts attached to those scenes contain incorrect logic that violates the overall system design.

## 4. Issues Identified

| ID    | Severity | Description                                                              | File(s) & Line(s)                                                              | Suggested Action                                                                                             |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R-001 | Critical | SEXP operators are hardcoded and not loaded from the core SEXP registry. | `target/addons/gfred2/sexp_editor/sexp_graph.gd` (`_create_operator_node`)     | Refactor to be data-driven, populating from `SexpFunctionRegistry`. Create new story for this rework.        |
| R-002 | Critical | SEXP node evaluation is not implemented; `compute_output` is a stub.     | `target/addons/gfred2/sexp_editor/sexp_operator_node.gd` (`compute_output`)    | Implement this method to call the core SEXP evaluation engine. Part of the rework story for R-001.         |
| R-003 | Critical | "Open Mission" dialog loads legacy `.fs2` files instead of `.tres` resources. | `target/addons/gfred2/dialogs/open_mission_dialog.gd`                          | Rework the dialog to use `MissionFileIO.load_mission_resource` and a standard `EditorFileDialog`. New story. |
| R-004 | Major    | "Save Mission" dialog is focused on exporting to `.fs2`.                 | `target/addons/gfred2/dialogs/save_mission_dialog.gd`                          | Rework to focus solely on saving `.tres` resources via `MissionFileIO`. Exporting should be a separate tool. |
| R-005 | Minor    | Legacy `input_manager.gd` file exists and is not used.                   | `target/addons/gfred2/input_manager.gd`                                        | Delete the file and confirm the core `GFRED2ShortcutManager` is used everywhere.                             |

## 5. Actionable Items & Recommendations

### New User Stories Proposed:
- **GFRED2-REWORK-001: Refactor SEXP Editor to Integrate with Core SEXP System**
  - **Description**: Rework the SEXP editor in GFRED2 to be fully data-driven, using the `SexpFunctionRegistry` to populate operators and the core SEXP engine for evaluation, validation, and debugging. This addresses issues R-001 and R-002.
  - **Rationale**: The current SEXP editor is a non-functional placeholder and a critical blocker for any mission logic work.
  - **Estimated Complexity**: Medium

- **GFRED2-REWORK-002: Align Mission I/O with Resource-Centric Architecture**
  - **Description**: Rework the "Open" and "Save" dialogs to exclusively handle `.tres` mission resources using the `MissionFileIO` class. Remove all `.fs2`-related logic from the main editor workflow. This addresses issues R-003 and R-004.
  - **Rationale**: The current I/O logic violates the project's core architecture and prevents the editor from working with converted assets.
  - **Estimated Complexity**: Medium

### Modifications to Existing Stories / Tasks for Current Story:
- **Story GFRED2-004**:
  - **Task**: Delete the orphaned `target/addons/gfred2/input_manager.gd` file (R-005).
  - **Task**: Perform a full audit of the GFRED2 codebase to ensure all other core utilities (math, error handling, etc.) have been properly integrated as per the story's original intent.

## 6. Overall Assessment & Recommendation
- [x] **Requires Major Rework**: The implementation has critical architectural flaws in its foundational components. The SEXP and File I/O systems, which are central to the editor's function, are implemented incorrectly and must be rebuilt according to the architecture. The existing code for these features is not salvageable and must be replaced.
