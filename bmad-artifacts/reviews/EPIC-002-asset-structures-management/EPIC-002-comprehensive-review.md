## 3. Architectural Review (Godot Architect Focus)

### Adherence to Approved Architecture
**Assessment**: Perfect alignment with architecture document. Implementation follows the exact patterns specified, including:
- Resource-based asset hierarchy as designed
- Plugin framework with autoload integration
- Circular dependency resolution using resource paths
- LRU caching system with memory management
- Type-safe validation framework

**No architectural deviations identified** - Implementation faithfully realizes the approved design.

### Godot Best Practices & Patterns
**Compliance Level**: Exemplary
- **Resource System**: Proper use of Godot Resources with export properties

| ID    | Severity   | Description                                      | File(s) & Line(s)      | Suggested Action                                   | Assigned | Status      |
|-------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| R-001 | Minor      | BaseAssetData.get_asset_type_name() hardcodes type mapping instead of using AssetTypes | `base_asset_data.gd:71-79` | Refactor to use AssetTypes.get_type_name() | Dev | Open |
| R-002 | Suggestion | Consider adding asset preview/thumbnail support to BaseAssetData | `base_asset_data.gd` | Add optional preview_texture property for editor | Dev | Future |
| R-003 | Suggestion | AssetLoader could benefit from progress reporting for batch operations | `asset_loader.gd` | Add progress signals for batch loading operations | Dev | Future |
