## 3. Architectural Review (Godot Architect Focus)

- **Adherence to Approved Architecture**: **Excellent** - Strictly follows EPIC-003 architecture with proper modular separation (Parser, Analyzer, Extractor) and clean interfaces between components.

- **Python Best Practices & Patterns**: **Outstanding** - Uses dataclasses for structured data, proper type hints throughout, clean separation of concerns, and follows Python conventions consistently.

- **Module Structure & Composition**: **Excellent** - Well-organized package structure with logical separation:
  - Core parsing (`pof_parser.py`)
  - Format analysis (`pof_format_analyzer.py`) 
  - Data extraction (`pof_data_extractor.py`)
  - Specialized chunk parsers (modular, focused)
  - CLI interface and testing infrastructure

- **Error Handling & Data Flow**: **Robust** - Comprehensive error handling with proper logging, graceful degradation, and meaningful error messages. Clean data flow from binary parsing to structured output.

- **Code Reusability & Modularity**: **Excellent** - Highly modular design with reusable components, clear interfaces, and proper abstraction levels. Components can be used independently or together.

## 4. Code Quality & Implementation Review (QA Specialist Focus)

- **Python Standards Compliance**: **Perfect** - Complete type annotations throughout (`BinaryIO`, `Dict[str, Any]`, `Optional[bytes]`), proper naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes), comprehensive docstrings for all public methods.

- **Readability & Maintainability**: **Excellent** - Code is exceptionally clear and well-organized. Complex logic is properly decomposed into focused methods (`_parse_chunks`, `_process_chunk`, `_verify_chunk_position`). Comprehensive inline comments explain non-obvious behavior.

- **Error Handling & Robustness**: **Outstanding** - Comprehensive error handling covering file I/O errors, malformed data, validation failures, and edge cases. Proper use of try-catch blocks with specific exception types. Graceful degradation with meaningful error messages.

- **Performance Considerations**: **Well-Designed** - Efficient streaming parsing, on-demand BSP data loading with caching, single-pass file processing. No obvious performance bottlenecks. Memory-conscious design for large files.

- **Testability & Unit Test Coverage**: **Comprehensive** - Excellent test infrastructure with `test_pof_parser.py` covering format analysis, data extraction, and integration scenarios. Tests include edge cases, error conditions, and validation scenarios.

- **Comments & Code Documentation**: **Exemplary** - All public APIs documented with clear docstrings including parameters, return values, and usage examples. Package-level documentation in `CLAUDE.md` is comprehensive. Code is self-documenting with clear naming.
