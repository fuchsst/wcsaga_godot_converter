# EPIC-005: GFRED2 Mission Editor

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: EPIC-005  
**Epic Name**: GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Epic Owner**: Larry (WCS Analyst)  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: 5% Complete - Planning Phase  
**Created**: 2025-01-25 (Original), Updated: June 7, 2025  
**Position**: 4 (Development Tools Phase)  
**Duration**: To be re-evaluated (Previously 9.6 weeks / 48 days)

## Epic Description
Create a comprehensive mission editor as a Godot plugin that recreates and enhances the functionality of the original WCS FRED2 (FReespace EDitor version 2) tool. This editor will allow mission creators to design, script, and test missions using modern Godot editor integration while maintaining full compatibility with WCS mission standards and exceeding the original editor's capabilities.

## Progress Summary
**Current Status**: Analysis Complete, Stories Updated, Ready for Prioritized Implementation (June 7, 2025)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Godot Plugin Limitations**: Editor plugin system may have constraints.
   - *Mitigation*: Early prototyping, work within Godot's plugin framework.
2. **Performance with Complex Missions**: Large missions may impact editor performance.
   - *Mitigation*: Efficient data structures, LOD for preview, background processing.
3. **SEXP Integration Complexity**: Visual SEXP editing is inherently complex.
   - *Mitigation*: Incremental development, extensive user testing, ensure EPIC-004 is robust.
4. **Dependency Stability**: GFRED2 relies on other EPICs being complete and stable.
   - *Mitigation*: Clear communication with teams for EPICs 001-004. Phased implementation for GFRED2 features based on dependency availability.

### Project Risks
1. **Feature Creep**: Tendency to add features beyond original FRED2.
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on core functionality first, defer enhancements.
2. **User Experience Complexity**: FRED2 is inherently complex.
   - *Mitigation*: User-centered design, workflow optimization, modern UX patterns.

### User Adoption Risks
1. **Learning Curve**: New interface may confuse existing FRED2 users.
   - *Mitigation*: Familiar workflow patterns, comprehensive documentation, tutorials.
2. **Compatibility Issues**: Missions created may not work in original WCS.
   - *Mitigation*: This is less of a concern if GFRED2 works with `.tres` files. The EPIC-003 tools would handle WCS compatibility if needed for export back to `.fs2`.

## Success Validation

### Functional Validation
- Create representative WCS missions successfully using the `.tres` workflow.
- Load, edit, and save `MissionData` resources without data loss.
- Validate SEXP expressions and mission logic correctly using EPIC-004.
- Export missions (if applicable, via EPIC-003 tools) compatible with game runtime.

### User Experience Validation
- Mission creators can complete tasks faster than original FRED2.
- New users can learn mission creation efficiently.
- Complex missions can be created and maintained.
- Error recovery and debugging is intuitive.

### Integration Validation
- Seamless integration with `wcs_asset_core` (EPIC-002).
- Proper integration with SEXP expression system (EPIC-004).
- Real-time testing works correctly with game runtime.

## SallySM Architectural Compliance Review (May 31, 2025)
(This section remains relevant as GFRED2-011 is the foundation for UI work.)

### Critical Implementation Issue Resolution
**Review Triggered By**: Comprehensive feedback analysis identifying architectural violations in current implementation  
**Story Manager**: SallySM  
**Review Date**: May 31, 2025

### Issues Identified & Resolved
1. **VIOLATION**: Current implementation uses hybrid UI approaches (programmatic + scene-based)
2. **VIOLATION**: No centralized scene structure as mandated by May 30th architecture
3. **VIOLATION**: `dialog_manager.gd` uses programmatic UI construction violating Godot best practices
4. **VIOLATION**: Mixed UI approaches across 5+ folders creating technical debt

### Stories Refined for Architectural Compliance
- **GFRED2-006A**: Enhanced with mandatory scene-based validation components
- **GFRED2-006B**: Refined with centralized scene structure requirements
- **GFRED2-006C**: Updated to eliminate mixed UI approaches
- **GFRED2-006D**: Enhanced with scene-based architecture mandates
- **GFRED2-007**: Refined with briefing editor scene requirements
- **GFRED2-011**: CRITICALLY enhanced with specific violation corrections

### Architectural Requirements Enforced
1. **100% Scene-Based UI**: NO programmatic UI construction allowed
2. **Centralized Structure**: ALL UI in `addons/gfred2/scenes/` exclusively
3. **Performance Standards**: < 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS UI updates
4. **Folder Elimination**: DEPRECATE `ui/`, `dialogs/`, `viewport/ui/` folders (except where they contain only scripts for scenes in `addons/gfred2/scenes/`)
5. **Clear Migration Strategy**: Specific steps to correct architectural violations

### Implementation Impact
- **BEFORE**: Architectural chaos with mixed approaches
- **AFTER**: Definitive scene-based architecture with clear compliance requirements
- **RESULT**: Stories now provide specific guidance to eliminate architectural violations

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR**: Implementation of GFRED2-011 (UI refactoring) is now **MANDATORY** to resolve architectural violations before proceeding with other stories.
