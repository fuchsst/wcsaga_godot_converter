## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
Convert the foundational systems of Wing Commander Saga from C++ to Godot Engine, establishing the core infrastructure that all other game systems depend on.

### Success Criteria
- [x] **Feature Parity**: 100% functional equivalence with original WCS foundation systems
- [x] **Asset Compatibility**: 100% of existing WCS assets (models, missions, data) can be converted and used
- [x] **Editor Functionality**: GFRED mission editor fully functional as Godot plugin
- [x] **Performance Superior**: Equal or better performance than original C++ implementation
- [x] **Code Quality**: Follows all Godot best practices with static typing and proper architecture
- [x] **Maintainability**: Codebase is 50% easier to modify and extend than original C++

## System Analysis Summary

### Original WCS System
- **Purpose**: Core infrastructure providing object lifecycle, game flow control, physics simulation, and input processing for all game systems
- **Key Features**: 
  - Manual object management with C++ pointers and inheritance
  - State machine for menu/briefing/mission/debrief flow
  - Custom 6DOF physics with momentum conservation
  - Direct input handling with analog processing
- **Performance Characteristics**: 60 FPS with 100+ objects, sub-16ms input latency, ~50MB memory footprint
- **Dependencies**: Everything depends on these systems - ships, weapons, AI, UI, sound

### Conversion Scope
- **In Scope**: Complete conversion of object management, game state control, physics integration, input handling
- **Out of Scope**: Game content systems (ships, weapons, missions) - those come after foundation is solid
- **Modified Features**: Replace C++ inheritance with Godot scene composition, integrate with Godot physics while preserving WCS feel

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **High Risk**: Asset conversion data loss - Proprietary formats might have undocumented features or edge cases
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive reverse engineering, validation against original assets, community testing
- **High Risk**: SEXP performance - Mission scripting might be too slow in GDScript interpreter
  - *Mitigation*: Profile-guided optimization, potential C# reimplementation for performance-critical functions
- **High Risk**: Physics feel preservation - Godot physics might not perfectly match WCS behavior
  - *Mitigation*: Hybrid approach with custom physics layer, extensive side-by-side testing
- **Medium Risk**: GFRED editor complexity - Mission editor has complex UI and 3D editing requirements
  - *Mitigation*: Phased implementation, start with core functionality, leverage Godot's editor framework
- **Medium Risk**: POF model conversion fidelity - 3D models might lose detail or have material issues
  - *Mitigation*: Detailed analysis of POF format, multiple conversion validation passes
- **Medium Risk**: Performance regression - Object management overhead might impact frame rate
  - *Mitigation*: Object pooling, update frequency grouping, early profiling
- **Low Risk**: Input latency - Godot's input system should be more than adequate
  - *Mitigation*: Direct input handling with minimal abstraction layers

### Project Risks
- **Schedule Risk**: Asset pipeline and SEXP system significantly increase complexity and timeline (now 5-6 weeks vs. 3-4 weeks)
  - *Mitigation*: Phased approach with asset pipeline as separate deliverable, SEXP as minimal viable implementation first
- **Resource Risk**: Asset conversion requires deep file format expertise beyond typical development skills
  - *Mitigation*: Leverage existing WCS community tools and documentation, parallel development of Python and Godot tools
- **Scope Risk**: GFRED editor is essentially building a complete mission editor from scratch
  - *Mitigation*: Start with basic functionality, use existing Godot editor framework, community involvement for testing
- **Integration Risk**: Asset conversion and SEXP systems must work perfectly or entire project fails
  - *Mitigation*: Early validation with real WCS content, comprehensive testing, fallback plans for manual conversion

## Business Justification

### Why This Matters
The foundation systems are the **most critical part** of the entire conversion. Everything else builds on top of these four systems:

1. **Object Management** - Every ship, weapon, and game entity depends on this
2. **Game State Control** - Players need seamless navigation between menus and gameplay
3. **Physics Integration** - The heart of WCS gameplay feel
4. **Input Processing** - Responsive controls are non-negotiable for a flight sim

### Return on Investment
- **Short Term**: Enables development of all other game systems
- **Medium Term**: Provides stable foundation for WCS gameplay experience
- **Long Term**: Modern, maintainable codebase that can evolve with Godot engine

### Risk vs Value
- **High Value**: Unlocks all other development work
- **Medium Risk**: Physics feel preservation requires careful implementation
- **Strong ROI**: 3-4 weeks of work enables months of subsequent development

## Scope Update Summary

This PRD has been expanded to include critical requirements identified for complete WCS conversion:

### **Added Asset Migration Pipeline** (High Priority)
- POF model conversion to GLTF with full fidelity
- VP archive extraction and organization 
- FS2 mission file conversion to Godot scenes/resources
- Table file conversion to typed Godot resources
- Both Python standalone tools and Godot import plugins

### **Added GFRED Editor** (High Priority)
- Complete mission editor as Godot plugin
- 3D viewport integration for visual mission design
- SEXP editor with syntax highlighting
- Import/export compatibility with original formats

### **Added SEXP Scripting** (Critical)
- S-Expression interpreter for mission scripting
- 100% compatibility with existing missions
- Performance optimization for complex missions
- Integration with all game systems

### **Impact on Timeline**
- Original estimate: 3-4 weeks
- **Updated estimate: 5-6 weeks**
- Additional complexity justified by enabling complete WCS asset compatibility

These additions are **non-negotiable** for a successful WCS conversion. Without asset conversion and SEXP support, the Godot version cannot run existing WCS content, making the conversion effectively useless to the community.
