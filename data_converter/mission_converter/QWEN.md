# Mission Converter Module - WCS Mission Processing

## Overview
The Mission Converter module handles the conversion of Wing Commander Saga mission files into Godot-compatible scene structures. This module processes mission logic, entity placements, and event scripting to create fully functional Godot scenes ready for gameplay.

## Key Components

### Mission Parser
- **MissionLoader**: Parses WCS mission files (.fs2) and extracts mission data including ships, waypoints, and events
- **EventTranslator**: Converts WCS mission events into Godot-compatible script sequences
- **EntityMapper**: Maps WCS entity types to Godot scene instances with appropriate properties

### Output Generators
- **SceneAssembler**: Constructs Godot scene trees from parsed mission data
- **ScriptGenerator**: Creates GDScript files for mission logic and event handling
- **ResourceBinder**: Links converted assets (ships, weapons) into mission scenes

## Conversion Process
1. **Parse Mission Data**: Extract entities, objectives, and triggers from .fs2 files
2. **Translate Events**: Convert WCS event scripts into Godot-compatible logic
3. **Assemble Scene**: Build Godot scene hierarchy with positioned entities
4. **Generate Scripts**: Create mission control scripts for gameplay flow
5. **Validate Output**: Ensure mission integrity and functional correctness

## Integration Points
- Consumes asset data from table converters for entity properties
- Utilizes core data structures for consistent data handling
- Outputs Godot scenes compatible with the main game framework
