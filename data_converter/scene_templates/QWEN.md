# Scene Templates Module - Godot Template Assets

## Overview
The Scene Templates module provides pre-built Godot scene templates that are used during the scene assembly process. These templates serve as reusable components for common gameplay elements such as weapon effects, engine thrusters, and subsystem behaviors, ensuring consistency and efficiency across all converted assets.

## Key Components

### Template Library
- **WeaponEffectTemplates**: Pre-configured scenes for laser beams, missile trails, and impact explosions
- **ThrusterTemplates**: Engine glow and particle effect scenes for different ship types and species
- **SubsystemTemplates**: Standardized scenes for targetable subsystems with damage states and functionality
- **DebrisTemplates**: Breakable debris pieces with physics properties and visual effects

### Template Integration
- **TemplateInstancer**: Handles the instantiation of template scenes during scene assembly
- **ParameterBinder**: Applies entity-specific parameters to template instances
- **ValidationTool**: Ensures template compatibility with target entities and scenes

## Usage Process
1. **Template Selection**: Appropriate templates are selected based on entity type and properties
2. **Instance Creation**: Templates are instantiated and positioned within the main scene hierarchy
3. **Parameter Application**: Entity-specific values are applied to template instances
4. **Integration Testing**: Templates are validated for proper functionality within the scene

## Integration Points
- Used by scene generators during scene assembly phase
- Provides consistent visual and behavioral components across all assets
- Supports customization through parameter overrides and scene inheritance
- Maintains compatibility with Godot's scene system and resource management
