## 3. Architectural Review (Godot Architect Focus)

### **Critical Architectural Violations Identified üö®**

**Adherence to Approved Architecture**: Implementation generally follows approved architecture but contains serious violations of Godot lifecycle patterns.

**Critical Issues**:

1. **Scene Management Lifecycle Violation** - `game_state_manager.gd:309-332`
   - Using `queue_free()` without proper `await tree_exited` patterns
   - **Impact**: Frame-based race conditions during state transitions
   - **Severity**: CRITICAL

2. **Synchronous Resource Loading** - `enhanced_transition_manager.gd:204-209`
   - Using `load()` instead of `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_*` API during transitions
   - **Impact**: Frame drops and stuttering during scene changes
   - **Severity**: CRITICAL

3. **RefCounted vs Node Architecture Mismatch**
   - Managers like `CampaignProgressionManager` use RefCounted but need Node lifecycle
   - **Impact**: Signal emission and timer management limitations
   - **Severity**: MAJOR

**Godot Best Practices & Patterns**: Mixed compliance - excellent static typing and signal usage, but lifecycle management violations.

**Scene/Node Structure & Composition**: Generally good composition patterns, but architectural choices violate Godot's intended lifecycle management.

**Signal Usage & Decoupling**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** - Comprehensive signal-based communication with proper typing.

**Code Reusability & Modularity**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** - Well-designed components with clear separation of concerns.

- No `Variant` types without explicit justification

**Readability & Maintainability**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- Clear, well-structured code with logical organization

**Testability & Unit Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ **VERY GOOD**
- 18 comprehensive test files covering all major components
- Well-structured GdUnit test cases with proper setup/teardown
- Edge case handling and error condition testing
- Signal emission validation

**Comments & Code Documentation**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- Detailed CLAUDE.md package documentation for each subsystem
- Clear API documentation with usage examples
- Architecture decisions properly documented
