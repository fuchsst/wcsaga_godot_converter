# User Story: Performance Optimization and Caching

**Epic**: EPIC-004 - SEXP Expression System  
**Story ID**: SEXP-009  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: SEXP system handling thousands of evaluations per frame  
**I want**: Advanced performance optimization with intelligent caching and monitoring  
**So that**: Complex missions run smoothly without frame rate impact regardless of SEXP complexity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: ExpressionCache class with LRU cache and statistical tracking as specified in architecture
- [ ] **AC2**: SexpPerformanceMonitor with detailed function call tracking and execution time analysis
- [ ] **AC3**: Context-aware caching that intelligently invalidates cache based on variable and object changes
- [ ] **AC4**: Performance hints system for optimization of frequently evaluated expressions
- [ ] **AC5**: Cache cleanup and memory management to prevent memory leaks in long missions
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance profiling integration for development-time optimization

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Performance Optimization Architecture and ExpressionCache sections
- **Godot Components**: RefCounted cache classes, performance monitoring, memory management
- **Integration Points**: Core evaluator engine, all SEXP functions, development debugging tools

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Performance patterns from original SEXP evaluation, caching strategies
- **Godot Approach**: Native Godot performance monitoring, signal-based cache invalidation
- **Key Challenges**: Cache invalidation logic, memory management, performance measurement accuracy
- **Success Metrics**: >90% cache hit rate, <1ms evaluation time, <10MB memory usage for complex missions

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: All core SEXP stories (SEXP-001 through SEXP-008), performance monitoring framework
- **Blockers**: Complete evaluator engine required for optimization implementation
- **Related Stories**: Enhances all other SEXP functionality, critical for complex mission performance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive caching and performance scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validate significant improvement over naive evaluation
- [ ] Memory usage testing confirms no leaks in long-running missions
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance profiling tools integrated for development workflow

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 4-5 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement ExpressionCache class with LRU cache and statistical tracking
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create SexpPerformanceMonitor with detailed execution time and call count tracking
- [ ] **Task 3**: Add context-aware cache invalidation based on variable and object state changes
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement performance hints system for optimization of frequent evaluations
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add cache cleanup and memory management for long-running missions
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create performance profiling integration for development-time analysis
- [ ] **Task 7**: Optimize critical evaluation paths based on profiling data
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive performance tests and validation benchmarks

## Testing Strategy
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark cache hit rates, evaluation speed improvements, memory usage
- **Stress Tests**: Long-running missions, high-volume evaluations, complex nested expressions
- **Memory Tests**: Validate cache cleanup, check for memory leaks, test cache size limits
- **Optimization Tests**: Verify performance hints improve actual execution speed

## Notes and Comments
**OPTIMIZATION CRITICAL**: This story is essential for making complex WCS missions playable. Performance must be measurable and significant.

Focus on intelligent cache invalidation - the cache must be aggressive enough to provide performance benefits while conservative enough to ensure correctness.

Memory management is crucial for long missions. Implement proper cache size limits and cleanup strategies to prevent memory bloat.

Performance monitoring should be lightweight enough to run in production while providing detailed information for development optimization.
