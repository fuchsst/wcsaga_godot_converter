# User Story: Core Function Library Framework

**Epic**: EPIC-004 - SEXP Expression System  
**Story ID**: SEXP-004  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: SEXP system that needs to support 444 operators  
**I want**: A modular function library framework with base interfaces and registration system  
**So that**: All SEXP functions can be implemented consistently with proper validation and documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: BaseSexpFunction abstract class with standardized interface (execute, validate_arguments, get_help_text)
- [ ] **AC2**: Function registration system that maps function names to implementations
- [ ] **AC3**: Argument validation framework with type checking and count verification
- [ ] **AC4**: Function metadata system with documentation, signatures, and categories
- [ ] **AC5**: Dynamic function discovery and loading system for extensibility
- [ ] **AC6**: Help system integration for function documentation and usage examples

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Function Implementation Architecture and Function Library sections
- **Godot Components**: RefCounted base classes, registration dictionary, reflection system
- **Integration Points**: Used by evaluator engine, required by all operator implementations

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/parse/sexp.cpp` function lookup and execution
- **Godot Approach**: Class-based function implementations, reflection for dynamic loading
- **Key Challenges**: Function registration efficiency, argument validation performance, extensibility
- **Success Metrics**: Support for all 444 WCS operators, efficient function lookup, clear validation errors

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: SEXP-001 (parser), SEXP-002 (expression trees), SEXP-003 (evaluator engine)
- **Blockers**: None - builds on evaluator foundation
- **Related Stories**: Required by all function implementation stories (SEXP-005, SEXP-006, SEXP-008)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with function registration and validation scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for function lookup and argument validation
- [ ] Example function implementations demonstrating the framework
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Framework ready for implementing all 444 WCS operators

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design and implement BaseSexpFunction abstract class with standard interface
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create function registration system with efficient name-to-implementation mapping
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement argument validation framework with type checking and count verification
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add function metadata system with documentation and signature information
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create dynamic function discovery system for plugin-style extensibility
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement help system integration for runtime documentation access
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create example function implementations demonstrating framework usage
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive unit tests for registration, validation, and execution

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test function registration, argument validation, metadata handling, help system
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark function lookup speed, argument validation overhead
- **Integration Tests**: Verify framework works with evaluator engine, test example implementations
- **Extensibility Tests**: Test dynamic function loading and registration of custom functions

## Notes and Comments
**FRAMEWORK FOUNDATION**: This story establishes the framework that will support all 444 WCS SEXP operators. The design must be flexible enough to handle the diverse function types while maintaining performance.

Focus on making function implementation as straightforward as possible since there are many operators to implement. The validation framework should catch common errors early and provide clear feedback.

The registration system must be efficient since function lookup happens frequently during evaluation. Consider using hash maps and caching strategies for optimal performance.
