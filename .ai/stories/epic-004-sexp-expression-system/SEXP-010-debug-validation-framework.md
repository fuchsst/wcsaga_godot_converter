# User Story: Debug and Validation Framework

**Epic**: EPIC-004 - SEXP Expression System  
**Story ID**: SEXP-010  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer debugging complex SEXP scripts and expressions  
**I want**: Comprehensive debugging and validation tools integrated with the development environment  
**So that**: SEXP errors can be quickly identified, debugged, and fixed with clear feedback and guidance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: SexpValidator class with comprehensive expression validation and error reporting
- [ ] **AC2**: DebugEvaluator with step-through debugging capabilities and breakpoint support
- [ ] **AC3**: Enhanced error reporting with contextual information, position tracking, and fix suggestions
- [ ] **AC4**: Visual expression tree display for debugging complex nested expressions
- [ ] **AC5**: Variable watch system with real-time updates during expression evaluation
- [ ] **AC6**: Integration with FRED2 editor for visual SEXP debugging and validation tested in `addons/gfred2/tests` folder using gdUnit4
- [ ] **AC7**: Tests implemented in `addons/sexp/tests` folder using gdUnit4

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Debug & Validation and Visual Editor Integration sections
- **Godot Components**: Debug dock integration, visual debugging controls, editor plugins
- **Integration Points**: FRED2 editor, expression evaluation, development workflow

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: FRED2 SEXP editor debugging features, validation error patterns
- **Godot Approach**: Editor dock integration, visual debugging UI, development-time validation
- **Key Challenges**: Visual representation of complex expressions, real-time debugging performance
- **Success Metrics**: Clear error messages, efficient debugging workflow, comprehensive validation coverage

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: All core SEXP stories (SEXP-001 through SEXP-009), visual editor framework
- **Blockers**: Complete SEXP system required for debugging implementation
- **Related Stories**: Enhances developer experience for all SEXP functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive validation and debugging scenarios
- [ ] Integration testing with FRED2 editor and visual debugging workflow
- [ ] User experience testing with complex SEXP debugging scenarios
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user guides)
- [ ] Visual debugging tools validated with real WCS mission files

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 4-5 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement SexpValidator with comprehensive validation rules and error categorization
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create DebugEvaluator with step-through debugging and breakpoint support
- [ ] **Task 3**: Enhance error reporting with contextual information and AI-powered fix suggestions
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build visual expression tree display for complex nested expression debugging
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement variable watch system with real-time updates and filtering
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create FRED2 editor integration for visual SEXP debugging workflow
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add performance profiling visualization for optimization guidance
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive testing and user experience validation

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test validation rules, error reporting, debugging functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Test with FRED2 editor, complex expression debugging, visual representation
- **User Experience Tests**: Validate debugging workflow with real mission design scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure debugging tools don't impact runtime performance significantly

## Notes and Comments
**DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE CRITICAL**: This story significantly impacts mission designer productivity. The debugging tools must be intuitive and provide actionable feedback.

Visual representation of complex SEXP expressions is crucial for debugging. Focus on clear, hierarchical displays that make nested logic easy to understand.

Error messages should not just identify problems but suggest specific fixes. Consider integrating AI-powered suggestions for common SEXP errors.

The debugging framework should be lightweight enough to not impact runtime performance while providing comprehensive information for development.
