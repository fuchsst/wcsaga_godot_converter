# User Story: Core Expression Parser and Tokenizer

**Epic**: EPIC-004 - SEXP Expression System  
**Story ID**: SEXP-001  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer using WCS SEXP scripts  
**I want**: A robust parser that converts SEXP text into structured expression trees  
**So that**: All existing WCS mission scripts can be loaded and processed correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: SexpTokenizer class implements advanced tokenization with all WCS SEXP token types (identifiers, numbers, strings, booleans, parentheses, comments)
- [ ] **AC2**: SexpParser class converts tokenized SEXP text into SexpExpression tree structures with proper nesting
- [ ] **AC3**: Parser handles all valid SEXP syntax including nested expressions, quoted strings, and numeric formats
- [ ] **AC4**: Comprehensive error reporting with line/column positions for syntax errors
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance-optimized regex patterns for tokenization as specified in architecture
- [ ] **AC6**: Validation functions for pre-parse syntax checking and error detection

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Enhanced Tokenization Architecture and Core Expression Engine sections
- **Godot Components**: RefCounted classes for parser/tokenizer, Resource classes for expressions
- **Integration Points**: Foundation layer for all SEXP evaluation and processing systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/parse/sexp.cpp`, `source/code/parse/parselo.cpp`
- **Godot Approach**: Use RegEx class for optimized pattern matching, static typing throughout
- **Key Challenges**: Handling nested parentheses, string escaping, numeric formats, error recovery
- **Success Metrics**: Parse 100% of valid WCS SEXP syntax, clear error messages for invalid syntax

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-001 foundation systems (CF-001 through CF-003)
- **Blockers**: None - this is a foundational SEXP system
- **Related Stories**: All other SEXP stories depend on this parser foundation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive SEXP syntax coverage
- [ ] Integration testing with various WCS mission file formats
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet <1ms parsing requirement for typical expressions

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS SEXP syntax and create comprehensive test cases
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement SexpTokenizer with optimized regex patterns and validation
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create SexpToken class with position tracking and error context
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement SexpParser with recursive descent parsing for nested expressions
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add comprehensive error handling with detailed error reporting
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement pre-validation functions for syntax checking
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write unit tests covering all SEXP syntax patterns and edge cases
- [ ] **Task 8**: Performance optimization and regex compilation caching

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test all token types, parser edge cases, error conditions, nested expressions
- **Integration Tests**: Parse real WCS mission files and validate expression tree structure
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark parsing speed with large mission files
- **Error Tests**: Verify helpful error messages for common syntax mistakes

## Notes and Comments
**FOUNDATION PRIORITY**: This story is critical foundation for all SEXP functionality. The parser must handle 100% of WCS SEXP syntax to ensure mission compatibility. Focus on robust error handling and clear error messages since mission designers will encounter parsing errors frequently.

Parser performance is critical since large missions may contain thousands of SEXP expressions. Implement regex compilation caching and consider lazy parsing strategies for complex nested expressions.
