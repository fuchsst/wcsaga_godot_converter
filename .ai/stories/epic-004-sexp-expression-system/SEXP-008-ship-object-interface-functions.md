# User Story: Ship and Object Interface Functions

**Epic**: EPIC-004 - SEXP Expression System  
**Story ID**: SEXP-008  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer controlling ships, objects, and game entities via SEXP  
**I want**: Complete SEXP function library for ship and object manipulation  
**So that**: All WCS ship control, status queries, and object manipulation work correctly in missions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Ship status query functions (ship-health, ship-shields, ship-distance, etc.) implemented
- [ ] **AC2**: Ship state modification functions (set-hull-strength, destroy-ship, etc.) implemented
- [ ] **AC3**: Object reference system for reliable ship/object identification and manipulation
- [ ] **AC4**: Integration with Godot ship/object systems via ShipSystemInterface
- [ ] **AC5**: Error handling for invalid ship references and missing objects
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance optimization for frequent ship status queries during missions

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: ObjectFunctions and ShipSystemInterface sections
- **Godot Components**: Function implementations, integration with ship/object Node systems
- **Integration Points**: Ship system, object manager, collision system, weapon systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/parse/sexp.cpp` ship and object function implementations
- **Godot Approach**: Node-based ship references, signal integration, type-safe object manipulation
- **Key Challenges**: Object reference management, integration with ship systems, performance optimization
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS ship/object functions working, reliable object references, efficient queries

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: SEXP-004 (function framework), ship system implementation, object management system
- **Blockers**: Ship system integration required for function implementation
- **Related Stories**: Critical for mission functionality, integrates with event system (SEXP-007)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive ship/object function coverage
- [ ] Integration testing with real ship nodes and object systems
- [ ] Performance testing for high-frequency ship status queries
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Error handling validated for all edge cases and invalid references

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 5-6 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement ship status query functions (health, shields, position, velocity, etc.)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement ship state modification functions (damage, destruction, movement, etc.)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create object reference system for reliable ship/object identification
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build ShipSystemInterface for integration with Godot ship/object systems
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add comprehensive error handling for invalid references and missing objects
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement performance optimization for frequent status queries
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add integration with collision, weapon, and subsystem management
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write extensive testing covering all ship/object manipulation scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test all ship/object functions, error conditions, reference management
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real ship nodes, complex object hierarchies, system integration
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark query performance with many ships, high-frequency calls
- **Edge Case Tests**: Invalid references, destroyed objects, missing systems, boundary conditions

## Notes and Comments
**INTEGRATION CRITICAL**: This story represents the primary interface between SEXP scripting and the game world. Ship and object manipulation must be seamless and reliable.

Object reference management is crucial - ensure references remain valid across game state changes and provide clear error messages when objects are not found.

Performance matters since ship status queries happen frequently during missions. Consider caching strategies and efficient lookup mechanisms for ship/object references.
