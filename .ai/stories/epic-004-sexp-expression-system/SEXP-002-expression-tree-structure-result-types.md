# User Story: Expression Tree Structure and Result Types

**Epic**: EPIC-004 - SEXP Expression System  
**Story ID**: SEXP-002  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: SEXP evaluation engine  
**I want**: Structured expression trees and comprehensive result types  
**So that**: SEXP expressions can be represented, evaluated, and debugged with full type safety

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: SexpExpression Resource class with all expression types (literal number/string, variable reference, function call, operator call)
- [x] **AC2**: SexpResult class with comprehensive type system (number, string, boolean, object reference, error, void)
- [x] **AC3**: Expression validation functions that check argument count, types, and nested structure
- [x] **AC4**: Enhanced error handling with contextual debugging information, position tracking, and fix suggestions
- [x] **AC5**: Resource serialization support for saving/loading expression trees
- [x] **AC6**: Debug string representation for visual debugging and error reporting

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Core Expression Engine and Enhanced Error Management sections
- **Godot Components**: Resource classes extending Godot's Resource base class for serialization
- **Integration Points**: Used by parser (SEXP-001) and evaluator (SEXP-003), foundation for all SEXP operations

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/parse/sexp.h`, SEXP result handling in mission parsing
- **Godot Approach**: Resource classes for persistence, static typing, comprehensive error types
- **Key Challenges**: Type safety across dynamic evaluation, error context preservation, serialization
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS expression types represented, clear error reporting, efficient validation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-001 foundation systems (CF-001 system globals), SEXP-001 parser foundation
- **Blockers**: None - core data structures
- **Related Stories**: Required by all other SEXP stories for expression representation

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [x] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [x] Unit tests written and passing with all expression types and error conditions
- [x] Integration testing with parser and basic evaluation scenarios
- [x] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [x] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [x] Serialization/deserialization working correctly with Godot's resource system

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] **Task 1**: Design and implement SexpExpression Resource class with all expression types
- [x] **Task 2**: Create SexpResult class with comprehensive type system and error handling
- [x] **Task 3**: Implement enhanced error types with contextual debugging information
- [x] **Task 4**: Add validation functions for expression structure and argument checking
- [x] **Task 5**: Implement Resource serialization support for expression persistence
- [x] **Task 6**: Create debug string representations for development and troubleshooting
- [x] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all expression types and error conditions
- [x] **Task 8**: Add integration tests with parser output validation

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test all expression types, result type conversions, error handling, validation functions
- **Integration Tests**: Verify parser creates valid expression trees, serialization round-trips work
- **Error Tests**: Comprehensive error condition testing with contextual information validation
- **Serialization Tests**: Test Resource save/load functionality with complex expression trees

## Notes and Comments
**TYPE SAFETY FOUNDATION**: This story establishes the type safety foundation for the entire SEXP system. All expression operations must be statically typed to prevent runtime errors and enable early validation.

The enhanced error handling system with contextual debugging information is critical for mission designer productivity. Error messages must be clear, actionable, and include position information for easy debugging.

Focus on making the expression tree structure intuitive for debugging while maintaining performance for frequent evaluation operations.
