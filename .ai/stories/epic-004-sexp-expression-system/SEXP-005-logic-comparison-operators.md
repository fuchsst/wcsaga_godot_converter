# User Story: Logic and Comparison Operators

**Epic**: EPIC-004 - SEXP Expression System  
**Story ID**: SEXP-005  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer writing conditional logic in SEXP scripts  
**I want**: All logical and comparison operators implemented correctly  
**So that**: Mission conditions, triggers, and decision logic work exactly as in original WCS

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: All logical operators implemented (and, or, not, xor) with proper boolean evaluation
- [ ] **AC2**: All comparison operators implemented (=, <, >, <=, >=, !=) with type-safe comparisons
- [ ] **AC3**: Arithmetic operators implemented (+, -, *, /, mod) with proper numeric handling
- [ ] **AC4**: String comparison and manipulation operators (string-equals, string-contains, etc.)
- [ ] **AC5**: Conditional operators (if, when, cond) with proper branching logic
- [ ] **AC6**: All operators follow WCS semantics exactly for edge cases and type coercion

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Function Implementation Architecture, LogicFunctions and ComparisonFunctions sections
- **Godot Components**: Function implementations extending BaseSexpFunction framework
- **Integration Points**: Used by all mission scripting, essential for conditional logic evaluation

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/parse/sexp.cpp` operator implementations, boolean logic handling
- **Godot Approach**: Type-safe implementations using function framework, proper error handling
- **Key Challenges**: Type coercion compatibility with WCS, proper null/undefined handling, performance
- **Success Metrics**: 100% compatibility with WCS operator behavior, efficient evaluation performance

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: SEXP-004 (function framework), all foundation stories (SEXP-001 through SEXP-003)
- **Blockers**: Function framework must be complete for operator implementation
- **Related Stories**: Required by mission integration (SEXP-007), will be extended by other operator groups

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive operator behavior coverage
- [ ] Compatibility testing with actual WCS mission scripts using these operators
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting evaluation speed requirements
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Integration testing with complex nested logical expressions

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 4-5 days
- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement all logical operators (and, or, not, xor) with proper boolean handling
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement comparison operators (=, <, >, <=, >=, !=) with type-safe comparisons
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, mod) with numeric type handling
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement string comparison and manipulation operators
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement conditional operators (if, when, cond) with branching logic
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add comprehensive error handling for type mismatches and edge cases
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write extensive unit tests covering all operators and edge cases
- [ ] **Task 8**: Performance optimization and compatibility validation with WCS behavior

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test each operator with all valid input types, edge cases, error conditions
- **Compatibility Tests**: Compare behavior with original WCS using identical test cases
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark operator evaluation speed, especially for nested expressions
- **Integration Tests**: Test complex logical expressions combining multiple operators

## Notes and Comments
**COMPATIBILITY CRITICAL**: These operators form the foundation of all mission logic. Their behavior must match WCS exactly, including edge cases and type coercion rules.

Pay special attention to type coercion and null/undefined handling since SEXP allows mixing types in ways that must be preserved for mission compatibility.

Performance is critical since these operators are used frequently in mission evaluation. Focus on efficient implementations without sacrificing correctness.
