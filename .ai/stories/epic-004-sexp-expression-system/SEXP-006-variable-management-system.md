- **Godot Approach**: Resource-based persistence, signal integration, type-safe variable handling
- **Key Challenges**: Scope management, persistence format compatibility, performance optimization
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS variable operations supported, reliable persistence, efficient access

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: SEXP-004 (function framework), EPIC-001 foundation systems
- **Blockers**: Function framework required for variable operation implementation
- **Related Stories**: Critical for mission integration (SEXP-007), required for campaign system

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive variable operation coverage
- [ ] Integration testing with mission loading and campaign save/load
- [ ] Persistence format validated for compatibility with WCS save files
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team

- [ ] Performance testing for variable access patterns in large missions

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 4-5 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement VariableManager class with scope management (local, campaign, global)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create SexpVariable Resource class with type safety and validation
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement persistence system for campaign and global variables
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create all SEXP variable functions (set-variable, get-variable, etc.)
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add signal-based change notifications for reactive variable updates
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement type conversion and validation matching WCS behavior
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add performance optimization for frequent variable access patterns
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests with persistence

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test all variable operations, scope management, type validation, persistence
- **Integration Tests**: Test variable persistence across sessions, mission loading with variables
- **Compatibility Tests**: Validate variable behavior matches WCS exactly including edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark variable access speed, memory usage with large variable sets

## Notes and Comments
**PERSISTENCE CRITICAL**: Variable persistence is essential for campaign progression. The system must reliably save and restore variables across game sessions without data loss.

Focus on type safety while maintaining compatibility with WCS variable behavior. SEXP variables can be dynamically typed, so the system must handle type changes gracefully.

Performance matters since variables are accessed frequently during mission execution. Consider caching strategies and efficient lookup mechanisms.
