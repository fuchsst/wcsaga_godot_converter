# User Story: Mission Event Integration

**Epic**: EPIC-004 - SEXP Expression System  
**Story ID**: SEXP-007  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission system that needs to respond to game events and trigger actions  
**I want**: Complete integration between SEXP evaluation and Godot's signal-based event system  
**So that**: Mission objectives, triggers, and events work seamlessly with all game systems

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: MissionEventManager class for registering and managing SEXP-based event triggers
- [ ] **AC2**: EventTrigger Resource class with condition/action expression pairs and trigger management
- [ ] **AC3**: Frame-based evaluation system that checks active triggers without impacting performance
- [ ] **AC4**: Signal integration connecting game events to SEXP trigger evaluation
- [ ] **AC5**: Mission objective integration with SEXP condition checking and completion actions
- [ ] **AC6**: Priority system for SEXP execution order and event trigger management

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Event System Integration and Mission System Integration sections
- **Godot Components**: Node-based manager, signal connections, Resource-based triggers
- **Integration Points**: Mission loading system, all game systems via signals, objective management

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/mission/missionparse.cpp` event triggers, objective checking
- **Godot Approach**: Signal-based event system, Node integration, frame-based evaluation
- **Key Challenges**: Performance optimization, trigger priority management, signal connection efficiency
- **Success Metrics**: Frame rate impact <1ms, reliable event triggering, seamless objective integration

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: All previous SEXP stories (SEXP-001 through SEXP-006), mission loading system
- **Blockers**: Complete SEXP evaluation system required for event trigger implementation
- **Related Stories**: Critical integration point for all mission functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive event trigger scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing validates <1ms frame impact with complex missions
- [ ] Integration testing with real WCS missions and objectives
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Signal connection optimization prevents memory leaks and ensures proper cleanup

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 5-6 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement MissionEventManager Node class with trigger registration and management
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create EventTrigger Resource class with condition/action expression handling
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement frame-based evaluation system with performance optimization
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add signal integration connecting all game systems to SEXP evaluation
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create mission objective integration with SEXP condition checking
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement priority system for trigger execution order and conflict resolution
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add comprehensive error handling and recovery for failed trigger evaluations
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write extensive testing covering complex mission scenarios and edge cases

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test trigger registration, condition evaluation, action execution, signal connections
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark frame impact with hundreds of active triggers
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real WCS missions, complex objective chains, event sequences
- **Stress Tests**: High-volume trigger scenarios, rapid event firing, memory usage validation

## Notes and Comments
**PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: This system will be called every frame for active missions. Performance optimization is essential to prevent frame rate impact.

Signal connection management is critical - ensure proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks and ensure triggers can be properly disabled/removed when missions end.

The integration between SEXP evaluation and Godot signals is a key architectural challenge. Focus on clean abstraction that doesn't tie SEXP logic directly to specific game systems.
