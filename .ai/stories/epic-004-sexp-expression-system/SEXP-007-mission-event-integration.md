- **Blockers**: Complete SEXP evaluation system required for event trigger implementation
- **Related Stories**: Critical integration point for all mission functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with comprehensive event trigger scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing validates <1ms frame impact with complex missions
- [ ] Integration testing with real WCS missions and objectives
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Signal connection optimization prevents memory leaks and ensures proper cleanup

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 5-6 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement MissionEventManager Node class with trigger registration and management
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create EventTrigger Resource class with condition/action expression handling
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement frame-based evaluation system with performance optimization
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add signal integration connecting all game systems to SEXP evaluation
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create mission objective integration with SEXP condition checking
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement priority system for trigger execution order and conflict resolution
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add comprehensive error handling and recovery for failed trigger evaluations
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write extensive testing covering complex mission scenarios and edge cases

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test trigger registration, condition evaluation, action execution, signal connections
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark frame impact with hundreds of active triggers
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real WCS missions, complex objective chains, event sequences
- **Stress Tests**: High-volume trigger scenarios, rapid event firing, memory usage validation

## Notes and Comments
**PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: This system will be called every frame for active missions. Performance optimization is essential to prevent frame rate impact.

Signal connection management is critical - ensure proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks and ensure triggers can be properly disabled/removed when missions end.

The integration between SEXP evaluation and Godot signals is a key architectural challenge. Focus on clean abstraction that doesn't tie SEXP logic directly to specific game systems.
