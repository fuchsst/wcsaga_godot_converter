# User Story: SEXP Interpreter Core System

**Epic**: Core Foundation Systems  
**Story ID**: CF-005  
**Created**: January 25, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer creating WCS missions  
**I want**: SEXP (S-Expression) scripts to execute exactly like original WCS  
**So that**: Existing missions run without modification and new missions can be created with familiar scripting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: SEXP parser correctly parses all S-Expression syntax used in WCS missions
- [ ] **AC2**: Core SEXP functions implemented (arithmetic, logic, conditionals, variables)
- [ ] **AC3**: SEXP interpreter runs at 60Hz without impacting game performance
- [ ] **AC4**: Variable system supports all WCS variable types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- [ ] **AC5**: Error reporting provides line numbers and meaningful error messages
- [ ] **AC6**: SEXP execution can be paused, stepped, and debugged for mission development

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/wcs-core-foundation-prd.md` - SEXP Scripting System section
- **Godot Components**: Custom GDScript interpreter, expression parser, runtime system
- **Performance Targets**: Process 100+ SEXP expressions per frame, <1ms execution time
- **Integration Points**: Interfaces with all game systems through standardized APIs

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `parse/sexp.cpp` SEXP parsing and execution system
- **Godot Approach**: Recursive descent parser with tree-based execution model
- **Key Challenges**: Performance optimization, complex expression evaluation, debugging support
- **Success Metrics**: Sample WCS missions run with identical behavior to original

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (Core Manager Infrastructure Setup)
- **Blockers**: Need complete SEXP function reference documentation
- **Related Stories**: Mission system and all gameplay logic depend on SEXP

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Performance targets achieved and validated
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Real WCS mission SEXP scripts execute correctly

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create SEXP parser for S-Expression syntax
- [ ] **Task 2**: Build expression tree data structure
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement core SEXP functions (math, logic, flow control)
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create variable system with proper scoping
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add runtime execution engine with performance optimization
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement error handling and debugging support
- [ ] **Task 7**: Integration testing with sample mission scripts

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Parser accuracy, function implementations, variable handling
- **Integration Tests**: Integration with game systems, mission loading
- **Performance Tests**: Execution speed under load, memory usage
- **Manual Tests**: Real WCS mission scripts, debugging interface

## Notes and Comments
CRITICAL HIGH RISK - SEXP performance could make or break the entire conversion. Consider C# implementation if GDScript proves too slow. Start with minimal viable implementation and optimize.
