# User Story: AI Manager and Ship Controller Framework

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-002  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer implementing WCS AI behaviors  
**I want**: A central AI management system and ship-specific AI controller framework  
**So that**: AI agents can be efficiently managed, coordinated, and controlled with proper lifecycle management and performance optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: AIManager singleton is created and properly registered as autoload for global AI coordination
- [ ] **AC2**: WCSAIAgent class extends LimboAI and provides WCS-specific AI agent functionality
- [ ] **AC3**: AIShipController integrates with ship objects from EPIC-009 and provides AI control interface
- [ ] **AC4**: AI personality system loads and applies personality traits to individual agents
- [ ] **AC5**: AI lifecycle management (creation, activation, deactivation, cleanup) works correctly
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance monitoring tracks AI processing time and entity count with frame time budgets

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: AI Management Hierarchy](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#ai-management-hierarchy)
- **Godot Components**: AutoLoad singleton, LimboAI extended classes, Resource-based personalities
- **Integration Points**: Ship objects from EPIC-009, Object Manager, Physics system integration

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/ai.cpp (main AI coordination), /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (individual ship AI)
- **Godot Approach**: Singleton pattern for management, component-based AI agents, resource-based personality system
- **Key Challenges**: Performance optimization, proper integration with existing ship objects, personality system design
- **Success Metrics**: <5ms AI processing per frame for 50+ agents, smooth AI lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-001: LimboAI Integration and Setup
  - OBJ-001: Base Game Object System (ship objects to control)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-003 (behavior trees depend on this framework)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets (50+ AI agents at 60 FPS)

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create AIManager singleton with AI registration and coordination systems
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement WCSAIAgent class extending LimboAI with WCS-specific functionality
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create AIShipController for ship-specific AI behaviors and controls
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement AIPersonality resource system with configurable traits
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add AI lifecycle management (spawn, activate, deactivate, destroy)
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement basic performance monitoring and frame time budgeting
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create integration tests with ship objects from EPIC-009
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all framework components

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - AIManager singleton functionality and agent registration
  - WCSAIAgent lifecycle and behavior management
  - AIShipController ship integration and control interface
  - AIPersonality system and trait application
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - AI framework integration with ship objects
  - Performance monitoring under load (multiple AI agents)
  - AI agent creation/destruction cycles
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - AI agents properly controlling ship movement
  - Personality traits affecting AI behavior
  - Frame rate maintenance with increasing AI count

## Notes and Comments
This framework establishes the core infrastructure for all WCS AI behaviors. The design prioritizes performance and modularity to support the complex AI behaviors that make WCS combat engaging while maintaining 60 FPS with many AI ships.
