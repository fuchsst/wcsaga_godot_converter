## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [x] **Task 1**: Create goal management system with all 25 WCS goal types and definitions
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement priority resolution algorithms for conflicting goals and objectives
- [x] **Task 3**: Design goal completion detection and automatic reassignment system
- [x] **Task 4**: Add multi-goal coordination and conflict prevention system
- [x] **Task 5**: Create goal inheritance system for formation and squadron coordination
- [x] **Task 6**: Integrate goal system with all existing AI behavior trees and systems
- [x] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for goal management and priority resolution
- [x] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with complex multi-goal scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Goal priority calculation and resolution algorithms
  - Goal completion detection accuracy
  - Multi-goal conflict resolution logic
  - Goal inheritance and propagation
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Goal system with all AI behavior systems
  - Complex multi-goal scenarios with priority conflicts
  - Formation goal coordination and inheritance
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - AI decision making quality with multiple goals
  - Goal system performance with many ships and complex objectives
  - Visual verification of appropriate goal-driven behaviors

## Notes and Comments
The goal system is the central intelligence that drives all AI decision making in WCS. It must provide the sophisticated priority management that allows AI ships to make intelligent decisions in complex, multi-objective scenarios.
