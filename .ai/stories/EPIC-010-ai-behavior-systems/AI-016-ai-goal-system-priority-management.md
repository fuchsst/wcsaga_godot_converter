# User Story: AI Goal System and Priority Management

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-016  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: AI coordination system managing multiple objectives  
**I want**: Sophisticated goal management and priority resolution system  
**So that**: AI ships make intelligent decisions about conflicting objectives while maintaining tactical effectiveness and mission focus

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Goal management system supports all 25 WCS AI goal types with proper priority weighting and conflict resolution
- [ ] **AC2**: Dynamic priority adjustment responds to changing tactical situations and mission requirements
- [ ] **AC3**: Goal completion detection automatically triggers goal reassignment and objective progression
- [ ] **AC4**: Multi-goal coordination prevents AI ships from having conflicting or ineffective goal combinations
- [ ] **AC5**: Goal inheritance allows formation members to inherit and adapt leader goals appropriately
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance optimization ensures goal processing scales efficiently with ship count and goal complexity

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: WCS-Specific AI Behaviors](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#wcs-specific-ai-behaviors)
- **Godot Components**: Goal management system, priority resolution algorithms, goal behavior tree integration
- **Integration Points**: All AI behavior systems, mission system, formation coordination, SEXP system

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aigoals.cpp, /source/code/ai/aigoals.h (complete goal system)
- **Godot Approach**: Resource-based goal definitions, priority queue management, behavior tree goal nodes
- **Key Challenges**: Priority conflict resolution, goal completion detection, performance with complex goal trees
- **Success Metrics**: AI makes intelligent goal decisions, goal conflicts resolved appropriately, efficient processing

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-015: Mission Integration and SEXP Behavior Response
  - AI-002: AI Manager and Ship Controller Framework
  - All previous AI behavior stories
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: This story integrates with all previous AI stories

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Goal system provides foundation for all AI decision making

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create goal management system with all 25 WCS goal types and definitions
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement priority resolution algorithms for conflicting goals and objectives
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design goal completion detection and automatic reassignment system
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add multi-goal coordination and conflict prevention system
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create goal inheritance system for formation and squadron coordination
- [ ] **Task 6**: Integrate goal system with all existing AI behavior trees and systems
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for goal management and priority resolution
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with complex multi-goal scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Goal priority calculation and resolution algorithms
  - Goal completion detection accuracy
  - Multi-goal conflict resolution logic
  - Goal inheritance and propagation
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Goal system with all AI behavior systems
  - Complex multi-goal scenarios with priority conflicts
  - Formation goal coordination and inheritance
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - AI decision making quality with multiple goals
  - Goal system performance with many ships and complex objectives
  - Visual verification of appropriate goal-driven behaviors

## Notes and Comments
The goal system is the central intelligence that drives all AI decision making in WCS. It must provide the sophisticated priority management that allows AI ships to make intelligent decisions in complex, multi-objective scenarios.
