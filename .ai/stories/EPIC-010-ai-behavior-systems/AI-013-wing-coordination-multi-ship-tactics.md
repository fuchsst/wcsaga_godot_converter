# User Story: Wing Coordination and Multi-ship Tactics

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-013  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: Squadron commander with multiple AI wingmen  
**I want**: Sophisticated wing coordination and multi-ship tactical behaviors  
**So that**: AI ships work together effectively as a coordinated unit with advanced tactics that enhance combat effectiveness and realism

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Wing coordination system enables synchronized attacks, defensive maneuvers, and tactical positioning
- [ ] **AC2**: Multi-ship tactics include pincer attacks, cover fire, mutual support, and coordinated missile strikes
- [ ] **AC3**: Dynamic role assignment adapts to changing battle conditions and ship capabilities/damage
- [ ] **AC4**: Communication system provides realistic coordination chatter and status updates between wing members
- [ ] **AC5**: Formation combat maintains tactical formations while executing coordinated attack and defense patterns
- [ ] **AC6**: Squadron-level objectives distribute tactical goals across multiple ships with appropriate task division

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: WCS-Specific AI Behaviors](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#wcs-specific-ai-behaviors)
- **Godot Components**: Wing coordination manager, multi-ship behavior trees, tactical communication system
- **Integration Points**: Formation flying from AI-007, combat behaviors from AI-009-012, communication systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (wing coordination), /source/code/ai/aibig.cpp (multi-ship tactics)
- **Godot Approach**: Distributed coordination system, shared tactical objectives, signal-based communication
- **Key Challenges**: Coordination without central control, emergent tactical behavior, performance with many ships
- **Success Metrics**: Coordinated attacks significantly more effective than individual actions, realistic tactical behaviors

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-007: Basic Formation Flying System
  - AI-009: Target Selection and Prioritization
  - AI-010: Combat Maneuvers and Attack Patterns
  - AI-011: Evasive Behaviors and Defensive Tactics
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-014 (formation management), AI-015 (mission integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Wing coordination creates visibly more effective and realistic combat scenarios

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create wing coordination manager with distributed tactical decision making
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement multi-ship behavior tree nodes (CoordinatedAttack, MutualSupport, CoverFire)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design dynamic role assignment system based on tactical situation and ship status
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add tactical communication system with realistic chatter and status updates
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate wing coordination with formation flying and combat behaviors
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create squadron objective system with goal distribution and task assignment
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for coordination algorithms and tactical behaviors
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with complex multi-ship combat scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Wing coordination decision making
  - Multi-ship tactical algorithm correctness
  - Role assignment logic and adaptation
  - Communication system coordination
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Wing coordination with all combat behaviors
  - Multi-ship tactics in various combat scenarios
  - Dynamic adaptation to changing battle conditions
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Visual effectiveness of coordinated tactics
  - Realistic wing coordination behaviors
  - Communication quality and tactical relevance

## Notes and Comments
Wing coordination represents the pinnacle of WCS AI behavior. It requires all previous AI systems working together to create the sophisticated, multi-layered tactical behaviors that make WCS combat unique and engaging.
