# User Story: Combat Maneuvers and Attack Patterns

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-010  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: AI pilot engaging in combat  
**I want**: Sophisticated combat maneuvers and varied attack patterns  
**So that**: Combat feels dynamic and challenging with realistic tactical behaviors that create engaging and unpredictable encounters

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: AI ships execute attack runs with proper approach vectors, firing solutions, and breakaway maneuvers
- [ ] **AC2**: Varied attack patterns (head-on, strafe runs, high-speed passes, sustained pursuit) create tactical diversity
- [ ] **AC3**: Combat maneuvers adapt to target type (fighters vs capital ships) and current tactical situation
- [ ] **AC4**: Advanced maneuvers include coordinated attacks, pincer movements, and energy management tactics
- [ ] **AC5**: Combat behavior integrates with weapon systems for optimal firing positions and attack timing
- [ ] **AC6**: AI skill levels affect maneuver precision, attack timing, and tactical decision making quality

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Combat AI Behavior](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#combat-ai-behavior)
- **Godot Components**: Combat maneuver behavior tree nodes, attack pattern definitions, tactical calculation systems
- **Integration Points**: Target selection from AI-009, weapon systems, ship movement controls, formation coordination

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aibig.cpp (combat maneuvers), /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (attack patterns)
- **Godot Approach**: Behavior tree combat nodes, maneuver calculation algorithms, pattern state machines
- **Key Challenges**: Realistic flight physics integration, varied but effective patterns, skill level scaling
- **Success Metrics**: Combat maneuvers appear natural and tactical, varied attack patterns, effective damage delivery

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-009: Target Selection and Prioritization
  - AI-005: Waypoint Navigation and Path Planning
  - AI-006: Collision Avoidance and Obstacle Detection
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-011 (evasive behaviors), AI-012 (weapon management)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Combat maneuvers create engaging and varied combat encounters

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create combat maneuver behavior tree nodes (AttackRun, StrafePass, PursuitAttack)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement attack pattern state machines with transition logic
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design maneuver calculation algorithms for different attack types and ship configurations
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add skill-based maneuver variation and precision scaling
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate combat maneuvers with weapon firing solutions and timing
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create target-specific attack patterns (fighter vs capital ship tactics)
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for maneuver calculations and pattern execution
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with complete combat scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Combat maneuver calculation accuracy
  - Attack pattern state machine transitions
  - Skill level scaling of maneuver quality
  - Weapon integration timing and positioning
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Combat maneuvers with target selection system
  - Attack patterns in multi-target environments
  - Combat coordination with formation systems
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Visual quality and realism of combat maneuvers
  - Tactical effectiveness of different attack patterns
  - Skill level differences in combat performance

## Notes and Comments
Combat maneuvers are what make WCS combat feel authentic and engaging. The system must provide both tactical effectiveness and visual spectacle while scaling appropriately for different AI skill levels.
