# User Story: Formation Management and Dynamic Formations

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-014  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: Squadron commander managing complex flight operations  
**I want**: Advanced formation management with dynamic formation changes  
**So that**: AI formations adapt intelligently to tactical situations, terrain, and mission requirements with smooth transitions and tactical effectiveness

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Formation manager handles complex formation types including custom formations for specific tactical situations
- [ ] **AC2**: Dynamic formation changes respond to tactical conditions (combat, navigation, terrain, threats)
- [ ] **AC3**: Formation transitions execute smoothly without breaking tactical effectiveness or ship coordination
- [ ] **AC4**: Advanced formation behaviors include combat formations, defensive screens, and escort patterns
- [ ] **AC5**: Formation adaptation considers individual ship capabilities, damage status, and role assignments
- [ ] **AC6**: Multi-squadron formation coordination manages large-scale fleet operations and capital ship escorts

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Formation Flying System](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#formation-flying-system)
- **Godot Components**: Advanced formation manager, dynamic transition algorithms, multi-squadron coordination
- **Integration Points**: Basic formation flying from AI-007, wing coordination from AI-013, mission objectives

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (formation management), advanced formation behaviors from WCS
- **Godot Approach**: State machine formation transitions, adaptive formation algorithms, hierarchical coordination
- **Key Challenges**: Smooth formation transitions, maintaining effectiveness during changes, large-scale coordination
- **Success Metrics**: Formation changes appear natural and tactical, maintained effectiveness during transitions

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-007: Basic Formation Flying System
  - AI-013: Wing Coordination and Multi-ship Tactics
  - AI-006: Collision Avoidance and Obstacle Detection
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-015 (mission integration for formation commands)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Formation management works effectively with large multi-squadron scenarios

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Extend formation manager with advanced formation types and custom pattern support
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement dynamic formation transition algorithms with smooth state changes
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create tactical formation adaptation logic based on situation assessment
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add multi-squadron coordination for large-scale fleet operations
- [ ] **Task 5**: Design formation damage adaptation considering individual ship capabilities
- [ ] **Task 6**: Integrate advanced formations with combat behaviors and mission objectives
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for formation management and transition algorithms
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with complex multi-squadron formation scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Formation transition algorithm correctness
  - Dynamic adaptation decision logic
  - Multi-squadron coordination algorithms
  - Formation damage response and adaptation
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Formation management with combat systems
  - Dynamic formations responding to tactical changes
  - Large-scale multi-squadron coordination
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Visual quality of formation transitions
  - Tactical effectiveness of dynamic formations
  - Large-scale formation coordination performance

## Notes and Comments
Advanced formation management represents the culmination of tactical AI coordination. It must seamlessly integrate all AI systems to provide the sophisticated fleet coordination that makes WCS large-scale battles distinctive.
