# User Story: Weapon Management and Firing Solutions

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-012  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: AI combat pilot with various weapons  
**I want**: Intelligent weapon selection and firing solution calculation  
**So that**: Weapon usage is tactically appropriate, accurate, and effective while managing ammunition and energy efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Weapon selection algorithm chooses appropriate weapons based on target type, distance, and tactical situation
- [ ] **AC2**: Firing solution calculation provides accurate lead angles and timing for moving targets
- [ ] **AC3**: Ammunition and energy management prevents waste while maintaining combat effectiveness
- [ ] **AC4**: Weapon firing coordination integrates with combat maneuvers and formation tactics
- [ ] **AC5**: Special weapon usage (missiles, torpedoes) follows tactical doctrine and target prioritization
- [ ] **AC6**: Firing discipline includes appropriate trigger control, burst firing, and target confirmation

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Combat AI Behavior](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#combat-ai-behavior)
- **Godot Components**: Weapon system integration, firing solution algorithms, ammunition management
- **Integration Points**: Weapon systems from ship/combat epics, target selection, combat maneuvers

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/weapon/weapons.cpp, /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (weapon usage patterns)
- **Godot Approach**: Behavior tree weapon nodes, firing solution calculations, resource management systems
- **Key Challenges**: Accurate firing solutions, weapon selection logic, ammunition conservation vs effectiveness
- **Success Metrics**: High weapon accuracy, appropriate weapon selection, efficient resource usage

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-009: Target Selection and Prioritization
  - AI-010: Combat Maneuvers and Attack Patterns
  - Weapon systems from ship/combat epic
- **Blockers**: Weapon system implementation
- **Related Stories**: Combat maneuver integration for firing positions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Weapon management creates effective and tactically appropriate combat

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create weapon management behavior tree nodes (SelectWeapon, FireWeapon, ConserveAmmo)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement firing solution algorithms for different weapon types and target velocities
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design weapon selection logic based on target characteristics and tactical situation
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add ammunition and energy management with conservation strategies
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate weapon firing with combat maneuvers and positioning systems
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create special weapon usage patterns for missiles, torpedoes, and capital ship weapons
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for firing solutions and weapon selection
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with complete combat scenarios and weapon systems

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Firing solution calculation accuracy
  - Weapon selection decision logic
  - Ammunition and energy management
  - Firing discipline and burst control
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Weapon management with combat maneuvers
  - Firing solutions with moving targets
  - Resource management during extended combat
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Weapon accuracy and effectiveness in combat
  - Appropriate weapon selection for different scenarios
  - Ammunition conservation vs combat effectiveness balance

## Notes and Comments
Weapon management is the culmination of combat AI effectiveness. The system must balance accuracy, effectiveness, and resource conservation while integrating seamlessly with all other combat behaviors.
