# User Story: Mission Integration and SEXP Behavior Response

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-015  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer and AI system  
**I want**: Deep integration between AI behavior and mission scripting systems  
**So that**: AI behavior responds dynamically to mission events and SEXP commands while maintaining contextual awareness and narrative-driven behaviors

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: SEXP integration allows missions to directly control AI behavior, goals, and tactical parameters
- [ ] **AC2**: Mission event system triggers appropriate AI responses to story events, objectives, and environmental changes
- [ ] **AC3**: AI context awareness adapts behavior based on mission phase, objectives, and narrative requirements
- [ ] **AC4**: Dynamic AI goal assignment allows missions to modify AI priorities and behaviors in real-time
- [ ] **AC5**: Mission-specific AI behaviors support unique scenarios like escort missions, defensive operations, and scripted sequences
- [ ] **AC6**: AI mission reporting provides feedback to mission system about AI status, objectives, and completion

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: SEXP Integration](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#sexp-integration)
- **Godot Components**: SEXP AI interface, mission event handlers, AI goal management system
- **Integration Points**: SEXP system from EPIC-004, mission system, AI goal management, behavior trees

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aigoals.cpp, /source/code/mission/missionparse.cpp (mission AI integration)
- **Godot Approach**: Signal-based mission integration, SEXP function registration, dynamic behavior modification
- **Key Challenges**: Seamless SEXP integration, maintaining AI autonomy with mission control, performance
- **Success Metrics**: Mission AI behaviors feel natural and responsive, SEXP commands execute reliably

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - SEXP-007: Mission Event Integration (from EPIC-004)
  - AI-002: AI Manager and Ship Controller Framework
  - AI-003: Basic Behavior Tree Infrastructure
- **Blockers**: SEXP system implementation
- **Related Stories**: Mission system integration stories

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Mission-driven AI behaviors work seamlessly with SEXP system

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create SEXP AI interface with behavior control functions and goal management
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement mission event handlers for AI behavior triggers and modifications
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design AI context awareness system for mission phase and objective adaptation
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add dynamic AI goal assignment and priority modification system
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create mission-specific behavior tree nodes and specialized AI patterns
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement AI mission reporting and status feedback system
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for SEXP integration and mission responsiveness
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with complex mission scenarios and SEXP commands

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - SEXP AI function execution and parameter handling
  - Mission event handling and AI response
  - Dynamic goal assignment and behavior modification
  - AI context awareness and adaptation logic
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - SEXP system integration with AI behaviors
  - Mission event system triggering AI responses
  - Complete mission scenarios with scripted AI behavior
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Mission AI behavior quality and narrative integration
  - SEXP command responsiveness and execution
  - AI behavior consistency during mission transitions

## Notes and Comments
Mission integration is critical for creating the narrative-driven AI behaviors that make WCS missions compelling. The system must provide mission designers with powerful tools while maintaining natural AI behavior.
