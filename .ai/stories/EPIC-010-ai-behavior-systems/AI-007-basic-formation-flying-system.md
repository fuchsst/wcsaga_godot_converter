# User Story: Basic Formation Flying System

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-007  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: Player commanding AI wingmen  
**I want**: Realistic formation flying with proper spacing and coordination  
**So that**: AI wingmen maintain tactical formations during flight and combat while responding appropriately to formation commands

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Formation manager creates and manages standard formations (Diamond, Vic, Line Abreast, Column)
- [ ] **AC2**: AI ships maintain proper formation positions with accurate spacing and orientation relative to formation leader
- [ ] **AC3**: Formation coordination handles leader changes and dynamic formation adjustments during flight
- [ ] **AC4**: Formation flying integrates with collision avoidance to prevent formation members from colliding
- [ ] **AC5**: Formation behavior trees respond to formation commands and tactical situation changes
- [ ] **AC6**: Formation integrity is maintained during navigation and basic maneuvers while allowing reasonable flexibility

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Formation Flying System](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#formation-flying-system)
- **Godot Components**: Formation manager, formation position calculation, formation behavior tree nodes
- **Integration Points**: Navigation system from AI-005, collision avoidance from AI-006, ship control systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (formation behaviors), formation flying logic from WCS
- **Godot Approach**: Formation manager singleton, behavior tree formation nodes, position calculation algorithms
- **Key Challenges**: Smooth formation transitions, maintaining spacing during maneuvers, formation-aware collision avoidance
- **Success Metrics**: Formation spacing accurate within 25m, smooth formation transitions, no formation collisions

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-005: Waypoint Navigation and Path Planning
  - AI-006: Collision Avoidance and Obstacle Detection
  - AI-003: Basic Behavior Tree Infrastructure
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: AI-013 (advanced formation tactics builds on this)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Formation flying works smoothly with 4-8 ship formations

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create formation manager with formation pattern definitions and position calculations
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement formation behavior tree nodes (MaintainFormation, FollowLeader, FormationMove)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design formation position calculation algorithms for different formation types
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add formation coordination logic for leader changes and dynamic adjustments
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate formation flying with navigation and collision avoidance systems
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement formation integrity monitoring and automatic correction
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for formation logic and position calculations
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with full formation scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Formation position calculation accuracy
  - Formation pattern definitions and spacing
  - Formation coordination and leader changes
  - Formation behavior tree node functionality
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Formation flying with navigation system
  - Formation integrity during collision avoidance
  - Formation transitions and dynamic adjustments
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Visual formation accuracy and spacing
  - Formation behavior during various maneuvers
  - Formation response to leader commands

## Notes and Comments
Formation flying is a signature feature of WCS that creates the tactical depth and authenticity of space combat. The system must balance tight formation discipline with realistic flexibility and responsiveness.
