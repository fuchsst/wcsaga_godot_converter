# User Story: Basic Behavior Tree Infrastructure

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-003  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer implementing WCS AI behaviors  
**I want**: A comprehensive behavior tree infrastructure with WCS-specific nodes and templates  
**So that**: Complex AI behaviors can be created using behavior trees with reusable components and WCS-authentic decision making

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Core WCS behavior tree node types (Actions, Conditions, Decorators) are implemented and functional
- [ ] **AC2**: Behavior tree templates for different ship classes (Fighter, Capital Ship, Support) are created
- [ ] **AC3**: Behavior tree manager handles loading, pooling, and execution of behavior trees efficiently
- [ ] **AC4**: Custom WCS action nodes for basic ship control (movement, targeting, firing) are implemented
- [ ] **AC5**: Custom WCS condition nodes for situational awareness (threat detection, formation status) work correctly
- [ ] **AC6**: Behavior tree debugging and visualization tools are functional in development builds

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Behavior Tree Architecture](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#behavior-tree-architecture)
- **Godot Components**: LimboAI custom nodes, behavior tree resources, debugging tools
- **Integration Points**: AI Manager from AI-002, ship controls, weapon systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/aicode.cpp (AI decision structures), /source/code/ai/aigoals.cpp (goal-based behaviors)
- **Godot Approach**: Custom LimboAI action/condition nodes, resource-based behavior trees, pooling for performance
- **Key Challenges**: Replicating WCS decision complexity in behavior trees, performance optimization
- **Success Metrics**: Behavior trees execute complex AI decisions, debugging tools show clear state visualization

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-001: LimboAI Integration and Setup
  - AI-002: AI Manager and Ship Controller Framework
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: All subsequent combat and navigation stories require this infrastructure

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Behavior tree editor shows custom nodes and debugging information

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create core WCS action node base classes (MoveTo, AttackTarget, FollowLeader)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement core WCS condition nodes (HasTarget, InFormation, ThreatDetected)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create behavior tree manager with pooling and lifecycle management
- [ ] **Task 4**: Design behavior tree templates for Fighter, Capital Ship, and Support ship classes
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement behavior tree debugging and state visualization system
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create behavior tree resource management and loading system
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all behavior tree components
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with AI agents using behavior trees

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Individual behavior tree node functionality
  - Behavior tree manager pooling and lifecycle
  - Custom action and condition node execution
  - Behavior tree template loading and validation
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Complete behavior tree execution on AI agents
  - Behavior tree debugging and visualization
  - Performance testing with multiple concurrent behavior trees
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Behavior tree editor functionality with custom nodes
  - Visual debugging tools showing AI decision state
  - Behavior tree switching and state transitions

## Notes and Comments
This infrastructure provides the foundation for all WCS AI behaviors. The behavior tree approach allows for complex, hierarchical decision making while maintaining the performance and authenticity required for WCS combat scenarios.
