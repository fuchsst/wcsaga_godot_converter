# User Story: Autopilot Integration and Player Assistance

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-008  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Completed

## Story Definition
**As a**: Player flying long distances or needing navigation assistance  
**I want**: Reliable autopilot system with intelligent navigation and safety features  
**So that**: I can focus on tactical decisions during long flights while maintaining situational awareness and safety

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: Autopilot system provides automated navigation to waypoints and objectives with player override capability
- [x] **AC2**: Safety systems automatically disengage autopilot when threats are detected or combat begins
- [x] **AC3**: Squadron autopilot maintains formation flying when multiple player-controlled ships are on autopilot
- [x] **AC4**: Time compression integration allows faster travel during autopilot navigation phases
- [x] **AC5**: Autopilot UI integration provides clear status indication and manual control options
- [x] **AC6**: Navigation assistance includes collision avoidance and threat detection during automated flight

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: AI-Object Communication](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#ai-object-communication)
- **Godot Components**: Autopilot manager, player assistance behavior trees, UI integration components
- **Integration Points**: Player ship controls, navigation system, threat detection, UI systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/autopilot/autopilot.cpp, /source/code/autopilot/autopilot.h
- **Godot Approach**: Player ship AI agent overlay, behavior tree autopilot modes, input system integration
- **Key Challenges**: Seamless player control handoff, threat detection reliability, UI feedback systems
- **Success Metrics**: Smooth autopilot engagement/disengagement, accurate navigation, timely threat response

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-005: Waypoint Navigation and Path Planning
  - AI-006: Collision Avoidance and Obstacle Detection
  - AI-007: Basic Formation Flying System
- **Blockers**: Player ship control system integration
- **Related Stories**: Formation flying stories for squadron autopilot

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [x] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [x] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [x] Integration testing completed successfully
- [x] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [x] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [x] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [x] Autopilot system works seamlessly with player input and UI systems

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [x] **Task 1**: Create autopilot manager with mode switching and control handoff systems
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement autopilot behavior trees using existing navigation infrastructure
- [x] **Task 3**: Add safety systems for automatic threat detection and autopilot disengagement
- [x] **Task 4**: Design squadron autopilot coordination for multiple player ships
- [x] **Task 5**: Integrate autopilot with player input system for seamless control transitions
- [x] **Task 6**: Create autopilot UI integration for status display and manual controls
- [x] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests for autopilot logic and safety systems
- [x] **Task 8**: Create integration tests with player ship controls and UI systems

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Autopilot engagement and disengagement logic
  - Safety system threat detection and response
  - Squadron autopilot coordination
  - Control handoff between autopilot and player
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Autopilot with navigation and collision avoidance
  - Autopilot UI integration and status display
  - Squadron autopilot with formation flying
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Player experience during autopilot transitions
  - Autopilot response to various threat scenarios
  - Squadron coordination during autopilot flight

## Notes and Comments
The autopilot system must feel like a natural extension of the player's capabilities rather than a separate AI system. Smooth transitions and reliable safety features are essential for player trust and gameplay flow.
