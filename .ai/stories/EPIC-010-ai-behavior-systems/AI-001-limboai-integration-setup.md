# User Story: LimboAI Integration and Setup

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-001  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working on WCS-Godot AI systems  
**I want**: LimboAI addon properly integrated and configured in the target project  
**So that**: I can use modern behavior trees for implementing WCS AI behaviors with proper tooling and debugging support

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: LimboAI addon is downloaded, installed and properly configured in target/addons/limboai/
- [ ] **AC2**: LimboAI addon is enabled in project settings with all required autoloads configured
- [ ] **AC3**: Basic behavior tree structure loads without errors in the Godot editor
- [ ] **AC4**: LimboAI behavior tree editor is accessible and functional in Godot editor
- [ ] **AC5**: Custom WCS behavior tree node base classes are created and registered with LimboAI
- [ ] **AC6**: Integration test scene demonstrates basic behavior tree execution on a test node

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: LimboAI Integration](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#limboai-integration)
- **Godot Components**: LimboAI addon, behavior tree resources, custom action/condition nodes
- **Integration Points**: Must work with existing wcs_assets_core addon and object system from EPIC-009

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/ai.h, /source/code/ai/ai.cpp (core AI framework structure)
- **Godot Approach**: Use LimboAI's behavior tree system with custom WCS-specific action and condition nodes
- **Key Challenges**: Ensuring LimboAI performance meets WCS requirements, custom node integration
- **Success Metrics**: Behavior trees load/save correctly, custom nodes appear in editor, test execution works

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - OBJ-001: Base Game Object System (from EPIC-009) - for AI agents to control objects
  - wcs_assets_core addon must be functional
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: All subsequent AI stories depend on this foundation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] LimboAI addon working in both debug and release builds

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Download and install LimboAI addon in target/addons/limboai/
- [ ] **Task 2**: Configure project settings to enable LimboAI addon and autoloads
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create base classes WCSBTAction and WCSBTCondition extending LimboAI nodes
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create simple test behavior tree demonstrating basic functionality
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create integration test scene with AI agent using behavior tree
- [ ] **Task 6**: Write unit tests for custom behavior tree node base classes
- [ ] **Task 7**: Document LimboAI integration and custom node usage

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - WCSBTAction base class functionality
  - WCSBTCondition base class functionality
  - Behavior tree loading and execution
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - LimboAI addon loads without errors
  - Custom nodes appear in behavior tree editor
  - Test behavior tree executes on test agent
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Behavior tree editor functionality
  - Custom node creation in editor
  - Behavior tree resource saving/loading

## Notes and Comments
This story establishes the foundation for all AI behavior in WCS-Godot. LimboAI provides the modern behavior tree framework that will replace WCS's custom AI system while maintaining the same behavioral complexity and performance.
