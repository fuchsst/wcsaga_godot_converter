# User Story: AI Performance Monitoring System

**Epic**: EPIC-010: AI & Behavior Systems  
**Story ID**: AI-004  
**Created**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: Draft

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer optimizing WCS AI performance  
**I want**: A comprehensive AI performance monitoring and optimization system  
**So that**: AI processing stays within performance budgets and the game maintains 60 FPS with 50+ AI ships

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: AI performance monitor tracks processing time per frame and per AI agent with microsecond precision
- [ ] **AC2**: LOD (Level of Detail) system adjusts AI update frequencies based on distance and importance
- [ ] **AC3**: Frame time budgeting system prevents AI from exceeding allocated processing time per frame
- [ ] **AC4**: AI analytics dashboard shows real-time performance metrics and bottleneck identification
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance profiling tools identify specific behavior trees and nodes causing performance issues
- [ ] **AC6**: Automated performance regression testing validates AI performance under stress conditions

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Architecture.md Section: Performance Optimization](../docs/EPIC-010-ai-behavior-systems/architecture.md#performance-optimization)
- **Godot Components**: Performance monitoring nodes, LOD management system, analytics dashboard
- **Integration Points**: AI Manager, behavior tree execution, ship object management

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: /source/code/ai/ai.cpp (AI performance considerations), profiling data from original WCS
- **Godot Approach**: Godot profiler integration, custom performance monitoring, time-sliced AI updates
- **Key Challenges**: Accurate performance measurement, effective LOD implementation, maintaining AI quality
- **Success Metrics**: 50+ AI ships at 60 FPS, <5ms AI processing per frame, intelligent LOD adaptation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - AI-001: LimboAI Integration and Setup
  - AI-002: AI Manager and Ship Controller Framework
  - AI-003: Basic Behavior Tree Infrastructure
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: Performance system affects all subsequent AI stories

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior
- [ ] Performance benchmarks demonstrate 50+ AI ships at 60 FPS

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create AI performance monitor with microsecond-precision timing
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement LOD system for AI update frequency management
- [ ] **Task 3**: Design frame time budgeting system with AI processing limits
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build real-time AI analytics dashboard for development builds
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create behavior tree profiling tools for performance bottleneck identification
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement automated performance regression testing framework
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add performance configuration system for different hardware profiles
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive performance benchmarking tests

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Performance monitor accuracy and precision
  - LOD system update frequency calculations
  - Frame time budgeting enforcement
  - Analytics data collection and reporting
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Performance monitoring with multiple AI agents
  - LOD system affecting AI behavior appropriately
  - Frame time budget preventing performance spikes
- **Manual Tests**: 
  - Analytics dashboard showing accurate real-time data
  - Performance regression testing with increasing AI loads
  - LOD system maintaining gameplay quality while improving performance

## Notes and Comments
This performance system is critical for maintaining the smooth gameplay experience that WCS is known for while supporting the complex AI behaviors. The LOD system must intelligently reduce AI complexity without noticeably affecting gameplay quality.
