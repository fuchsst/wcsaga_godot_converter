# User Story: Mission Data Resource System

**Story ID**: STORY-005  
**Epic**: EPIC-002 (FRED2 Mission Editor)  
**Phase**: 1 (Foundation)  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Assignee**: Dev (GDScript Developer)

## User Story

**As a** mission creator  
**I want** a robust mission data system that can handle all WCS mission information  
**So that** I can create, edit, and save missions with complete data integrity

## Background Context

The Mission Data Resource System forms the foundation of our mission editor, replacing FRED2's C++ mission structures with Godot's type-safe Resource system. This system must handle all mission data including objects, events, goals, briefings, and metadata while providing seamless serialization and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Core Mission Data Structure
```gherkin
Given I am developing the mission editor
When I implement the MissionData resource
Then it should include all essential mission properties:
  - Mission info (name, author, description, version)
  - Mission objects array (ships, waypoints, etc.)
  - Wing formations array
  - Mission events array
  - Mission goals array  
  - Briefing data
  - Background/environment data
And it should use proper GDScript static typing throughout
And it should extend Godot's Resource class for serialization
```

### AC-2: Mission Object Data Structure
```gherkin
Given I am creating mission objects
When I implement the MissionObject resource
Then it should include all FRED2 object properties:
  - Object name and type
  - 3D position and rotation
  - Ship class and team assignment
  - AI behavior configuration
  - Arrival and departure conditions (SEXP references)
  - Special properties and flags
And it should provide property change signals
And it should validate data integrity on modification
```

### AC-3: Resource Serialization
```gherkin
Given I have mission data loaded in memory
When I save the mission to a Godot resource file
Then it should serialize all data without loss
And it should load back identically
And it should be compatible with Godot's resource system
And it should support both .tres and .res formats
```

### AC-4: Data Validation System
```gherkin
Given I have mission data with potential errors
When I call the validation system
Then it should check for:
  - Required fields are not empty
  - Numeric values are within valid ranges
  - Object references are valid
  - SEXP tree references exist
And it should return comprehensive validation results
And it should provide specific error messages and locations
```

### AC-5: Signal-Based Change Notification
```gherkin
Given I have mission data loaded
When any mission property is modified
Then it should emit a data_changed signal
And the signal should include the property name, old value, and new value
And it should allow UI components to update reactively
And it should support undo/redo functionality
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Core Classes Required
```gdscript
# Primary mission data container
class_name MissionData extends Resource

# Individual mission objects (ships, waypoints, etc.)
class_name MissionObject extends Resource

# Mission metadata and info
class_name MissionInfo extends Resource

# Wing formation data
class_name WingFormation extends Resource

# Mission events and goals
class_name MissionEvent extends Resource
class_name MissionGoal extends Resource

# Briefing and background data
class_name BriefingData extends Resource
class_name BackgroundData extends Resource

# Validation result container
class_name ValidationResult extends RefCounted
```

### File Structure
```
target/scripts/resources/mission/
├── mission_data.gd              # Core MissionData resource
├── mission_object.gd            # Individual object data
├── mission_info.gd              # Mission metadata
├── wing_formation.gd            # Wing data
├── mission_event.gd             # Event data
├── mission_goal.gd              # Goal data
├── briefing_data.gd             # Briefing information
├── background_data.gd           # Environment data
└── validation_result.gd         # Validation results
```

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with future FS2 import/export system
- Should provide foundation for 3D viewport object representation
- Must support future SEXP system integration
- Should enable property inspector binding

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All mission data classes implemented with static typing
- [ ] Complete property coverage matching FRED2 capabilities
- [ ] Resource serialization working for all data types
- [ ] Validation system operational with comprehensive checks
- [ ] Signal-based change notification implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written for all core functionality (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests validate data round-trip integrity
- [ ] Performance tests verify large mission handling
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated with class references

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test all resource classes for proper serialization
- Validate type safety and constraint checking
- Test signal emission on property changes
- Verify validation logic for edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test complete mission data workflows
- Validate complex mission scenarios
- Test performance with large datasets
- Verify memory usage patterns

### Performance Benchmarks
- Large mission loading (<3 seconds for 500+ objects)
- Memory usage for complex missions (<50MB)
- Validation performance (<500ms for typical missions)

## Dependencies

**Requires**:
- Godot 4.4+ Resource system
- Static typing enforcement
- Signal system for change notification

**Blocks**:
- STORY-006: FS2 Import/Export (needs data structures)
- STORY-007: 3D Viewport Integration (needs object data)
- STORY-008: Object Management (needs data foundation)

## Notes

This story establishes the critical foundation for all mission editor functionality. The resource-based approach provides type safety, serialization, and Godot integration while maintaining compatibility with WCS mission requirements.

The implementation should prioritize data integrity and type safety over performance optimizations, which can be addressed in later optimization phases.
