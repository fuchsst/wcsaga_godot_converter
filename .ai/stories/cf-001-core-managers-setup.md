# User Story: Core Manager Infrastructure Setup

**Epic**: Core Foundation Systems  
**Story ID**: CF-001  
**Created**: January 25, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working on WCS-Godot conversion  
**I want**: Basic infrastructure for the four core manager singletons (ObjectManager, GameStateManager, PhysicsManager, InputManager)  
**So that**: All subsequent development work has a solid foundation to build upon

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Four autoload singleton scripts created with proper static typing and basic structure
- [ ] **AC2**: Each manager has initialization, update, and cleanup methods with proper error handling
- [ ] **AC3**: Signal architecture implemented for inter-manager communication
- [ ] **AC4**: Basic unit tests verify managers can be instantiated and initialized without errors
- [ ] **AC5**: Debug overlay shows manager status and basic performance metrics

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/wcs-core-foundation-architecture.md` - Scene Architecture section
- **Godot Components**: Autoload singletons, Node classes, custom signals
- **Performance Targets**: <1 second initialization time, <5MB memory footprint per manager
- **Integration Points**: Signal-based communication between all managers

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `freespace.cpp` main loop structure, object system initialization
- **Godot Approach**: Autoload singletons with composition pattern, avoid inheritance hierarchies
- **Key Challenges**: Proper initialization order, circular dependency prevention
- **Success Metrics**: All managers initialize successfully, signal connections verified

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: None (foundational story)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: All other foundation stories depend on this

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Performance targets achieved and validated
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Debug overlay functional for development visibility

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create ObjectManager autoload with basic structure and signals
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create GameStateManager autoload with state enumeration and transitions
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create PhysicsManager autoload with physics world integration
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create InputManager autoload with action processing framework
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement signal connections and communication patterns
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create debug overlay showing manager status
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write unit tests for each manager's basic functionality

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test manager initialization, signal emission/reception, basic state management
- **Integration Tests**: Verify managers can communicate via signals without circular dependencies
- **Performance Tests**: Measure initialization time and memory usage
- **Manual Tests**: Debug overlay shows correct information, no error messages on startup

## Notes and Comments
This is the foundational story that everything else builds on. Must be rock-solid before proceeding to other stories. Focus on clean architecture and proper error handling.
