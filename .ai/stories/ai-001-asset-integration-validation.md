# AI-001: Load and Validate Real WCS Assets

## User Story
**As a** developer converting WCS to Godot  
**I need** to successfully load and validate real WCS assets from VP archives  
**So that** I can verify our asset pipeline works with actual game content before building gameplay systems

## Epic
Asset Integration & Validation

## Priority
High

## Complexity
Medium (2-3 days effort)

## Risk Level
Medium - Depends on real WCS data availability and format variations

## Dependencies
- CF-001: Core Manager Infrastructure Setup (✅ Completed)
- CF-002: Asset Pipeline Foundation (✅ Completed)

## Technical Scope

### VP Archive Integration
- Load real WCS VP archives (root_fs2.vp, sparks_m_01.vp, etc.)
- Test VPManager with multiple archive precedence
- Validate file extraction and directory navigation
- Handle any format variations not covered in our implementation

### Table File Validation
- Parse real ships.tbl and weapons.tbl files
- Create ShipData and WeaponData resources from actual game data
- Validate all WCS table syntax and expressions work correctly
- Test preprocessor directives and conditional blocks

### Model Conversion Testing
- Convert actual POF ship models to Godot TSCN format
- Verify hardpoint preservation (guns, missiles, thrusters)
- Test texture mapping and material assignment
- Validate collision mesh generation

### Asset Manager Integration
- Test unified asset loading through AssetManager
- Validate caching and performance with real data
- Test auto-migration functionality
- Verify resource cleanup and memory management

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ VP Archive Loading
- [ ] Successfully loads at least 3 real WCS VP archives
- [ ] VPManager correctly handles file precedence across archives
- [ ] Can extract and list all files from loaded archives
- [ ] Directory navigation works with real WCS directory structure
- [ ] Performance meets <10ms per file access target
- [ ] No memory leaks or excessive memory usage

### ✅ Table File Processing
- [ ] Successfully parses ships.tbl with all ship entries
- [ ] Successfully parses weapons.tbl with all weapon entries
- [ ] Creates valid ShipData resources for at least 10 ships
- [ ] Creates valid WeaponData resources for at least 15 weapons
- [ ] Handles all WCS table syntax variations found in real files
- [ ] Reports parsing errors clearly with line numbers
- [ ] Performance meets <50ms parsing target for typical files

### ✅ Model Conversion
- [ ] Converts at least 5 different POF ship models successfully
- [ ] Preserves all hardpoint locations (guns, missiles, thrusters, docking)
- [ ] Generated TSCN files load correctly in Godot editor
- [ ] Collision meshes are generated and functional
- [ ] Model scale and orientation match WCS originals
- [ ] Conversion time meets <200ms target for standard ships
- [ ] Creates proper Godot material assignments

### ✅ Integration Testing
- [ ] AssetManager can load all converted assets without errors
- [ ] Cache system works correctly with real asset load patterns
- [ ] Auto-migration works for missing assets from VP archives
- [ ] All subsystems integrate properly (no initialization order issues)
- [ ] Debug overlay shows accurate asset pipeline statistics
- [ ] Memory usage stays within reasonable bounds (<100MB for test set)

### ✅ Validation and Quality
- [ ] Unit tests pass with real data samples
- [ ] No crashes or unhandled exceptions during asset loading
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully for corrupted/missing files
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet all specified targets
- [ ] Converted assets maintain visual fidelity to originals
- [ ] Asset metadata is preserved correctly

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: VP Archive Integration (Day 1)
1. Acquire real WCS VP archives for testing
2. Test VPArchive with actual VP file formats
3. Handle any format variations or edge cases
4. Validate file extraction and directory handling
5. Performance testing with real archive sizes

### Phase 2: Table File Validation (Day 1-2)
1. Test TableParser with real ships.tbl and weapons.tbl
2. Handle all syntax variations found in actual files
3. Create comprehensive ShipData and WeaponData resources
4. Validate all WCS expressions and conditionals
5. Performance optimization for large table files

### Phase 3: Model Conversion Testing (Day 2)
1. Test POFMigrator with diverse ship models
2. Validate hardpoint preservation and metadata
3. Test texture mapping and material assignment
4. Verify collision mesh generation
5. Performance optimization for complex models

### Phase 4: Integration and Validation (Day 2-3)
1. End-to-end testing through AssetManager
2. Performance benchmarking with real asset loads
3. Memory usage profiling and optimization
4. Error handling validation with edge cases
5. Documentation updates based on real-world usage

## Performance Targets
- VP archive loading: <500ms for typical archive
- File extraction: <10ms per file
- Table parsing: <50ms for ships.tbl/weapons.tbl
- POF conversion: <200ms for standard ship models
- Asset cache hit ratio: >90% for repeated access
- Memory usage: <100MB for typical asset set

## Risk Mitigation
- **Format Variations**: Test with diverse WCS mods and versions
- **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize hot paths early
- **Memory Usage**: Implement proper cleanup and cache limits
- **File Corruption**: Robust error handling and validation
- **Missing Assets**: Graceful fallbacks and placeholder systems
