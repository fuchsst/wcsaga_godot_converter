# User Story: FS2 Mission File Import/Export

**Story ID**: STORY-006  
**Epic**: EPIC-002 (FRED2 Mission Editor)  
**Phase**: 1 (Foundation)  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Assignee**: Dev (GDScript Developer)

## User Story

**As a** mission creator  
**I want** to import existing .fs2 mission files and export missions back to .fs2 format  
**So that** I can work with existing WCS missions and maintain compatibility with the WCS runtime

## Background Context

The FS2 import/export system bridges the gap between legacy FRED2 missions and our new Godot-based editor. This system must handle the complex .fs2 text format with perfect fidelity while providing robust error handling for corrupted or edge-case files.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: FS2 Mission File Import
```gherkin
Given I have an existing .fs2 mission file
When I import it using the mission editor
Then it should parse all mission sections correctly:
  - #Mission Info (name, author, version, description)
  - #Objects (ships with full configuration)
  - #Wings (formation data)
  - #Events (SEXP-based mission events)
  - #Goals (mission objectives)
  - #Plot Info (additional plot data)
  - #Background (starfield and environment)
  - #Briefing (briefing data and animations)
And it should create valid MissionData resources
And it should handle all WCS mission file variations
And it should provide detailed error reporting for invalid files
```

### AC-2: FS2 Mission File Export
```gherkin
Given I have mission data in the editor
When I export to .fs2 format
Then it should generate a valid .fs2 file
And the file should be readable by original FRED2
And the file should work correctly in WCS runtime
And it should maintain all mission data without loss
And it should format the output correctly with proper sections
```

### AC-3: Robust Error Handling
```gherkin
Given I import a corrupted or invalid .fs2 file
When the import process encounters errors
Then it should provide specific error messages with line numbers
And it should attempt to recover partial data where possible
And it should not crash the editor
And it should log detailed information for debugging
And it should suggest possible fixes for common issues
```

### AC-4: Progress Reporting
```gherkin
Given I am importing a large mission file
When the import process is running
Then it should show progress updates to the user
And it should indicate which section is currently being processed
And it should provide estimated time remaining
And it should allow cancellation of long-running imports
```

### AC-5: Validation and Compatibility
```gherkin
Given I have imported and exported a mission file
When I compare the original and exported versions
Then the exported mission should function identically in WCS
And all mission objects should be positioned correctly
And all SEXP trees should evaluate the same way
And all mission metadata should be preserved
And the round-trip should preserve all data accurately
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue parsing even with errors in individual sections
- **Detailed Logging**: Record all issues with file locations and context
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Attempt to parse partial data where possible
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with suggested fixes

## Definition of Done

- [ ] FS2 import system handles all standard mission file sections
- [ ] FS2 export generates compatible files for WCS runtime
- [ ] Error handling provides useful feedback for problematic files
- [ ] Progress reporting keeps users informed during long operations
- [ ] Round-trip compatibility verified with existing mission files
- [ ] Performance targets met (import 500+ object missions in <5 seconds)
- [ ] Unit tests written for all parser components (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests validate real mission file compatibility
- [ ] Stress tests with large and edge-case mission files
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation includes FS2 format specifications and usage examples

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual section parsers with isolated data
- Validate error handling with malformed input
- Test writer output format compliance
- Verify data type conversions and validations

### Integration Tests  
- Test complete mission file round-trips
- Validate compatibility with real WCS mission files
- Test error recovery with partially corrupted files
- Verify performance with large mission files

### Compatibility Tests
- Import all existing WCS mission files from campaign
- Export and re-import missions to verify data preservation
- Test exported missions in actual WCS runtime
- Validate SEXP tree preservation and functionality

### Performance Tests
- Large mission import/export performance
- Memory usage during processing
- Progress reporting accuracy
- Cancellation responsiveness

## Dependencies

**Requires**:
- STORY-005: Mission Data Resource System (foundation data structures)
- File I/O utilities from Godot standard library
- String parsing and manipulation utilities

**Provides Foundation For**:
- STORY-007: 3D Viewport Integration (mission loading)
- STORY-008: Object Management (object creation)
- All future mission editing functionality

**Test Data Requirements**:
- Collection of real WCS mission files for testing
- Edge case and corrupted files for error handling tests
- Large mission files for performance testing

## Special Considerations

### Legacy Format Quirks
- Handle variations in section ordering
- Support optional sections and fields
- Manage different version formats
- Deal with custom modifications and comments

### Performance Optimization
- Stream large files rather than loading entirely into memory
- Provide cancellation points for long operations
- Use efficient string parsing algorithms
- Cache frequently accessed data

### User Experience
- Clear progress indication with meaningful messages
- Helpful error messages with suggested fixes
- Preview capabilities before full import
- Backup recommendations before export operations

## Integration Points

**Mission Editor Integration**:
- File menu import/export options
- Drag-and-drop file handling
- Recent files management
- Project-wide mission management

**Data Pipeline Integration**:
- Seamless conversion to MissionData resources
- Validation integration with import process
- Asset reference resolution
- Undo/redo support for import operations
