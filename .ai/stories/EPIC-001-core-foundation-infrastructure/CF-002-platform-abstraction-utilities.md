# User Story: Platform Abstraction and Utilities

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-002  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer converting WCS systems to Godot  
**I want**: Cross-platform utility functions and platform abstraction layer  
**So that**: WCS systems work identically across Windows, Linux, and macOS without platform-specific code

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: PlatformUtils class provides cross-platform file system operations (directory creation, path resolution, permissions)
- [ ] **AC2**: Registry/settings functionality replaced with Godot's native ConfigFile system maintaining WCS behavior
- [ ] **AC3**: Debug output system routes to Godot's print functions with proper log levels and filtering
- [ ] **AC4**: System information functions (OS version, hardware capabilities) use Godot's OS singleton
- [ ] **AC5**: All platform differences are abstracted behind consistent APIs with identical behavior
- [ ] **AC6**: Error handling provides meaningful messages and graceful degradation on all platforms

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Foundation Layer Structure - Platform Utils section
- **Godot Components**: Utility classes using OS singleton, FileAccess, and ConfigFile
- **Integration Points**: Used by all systems requiring file operations, settings, or debug output

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/osapi/osapi.cpp`, `osregistry.cpp`, `outwnd.cpp`
- **Godot Approach**: Leverage Godot's built-in cross-platform abstractions instead of custom implementations
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining WCS registry behavior using ConfigFile, ensuring debug output compatibility
- **Success Metrics**: Identical behavior on all platforms, zero platform-specific compilation flags needed

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (System Globals and Types) for constants and type definitions
- **Blockers**: None - uses Godot built-in systems
- **Related Stories**: All future CF stories will use these platform utilities

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Platform behavior validated against original WCS functionality

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS osapi.cpp for required platform abstraction functions
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create PlatformUtils class with file system operations using Godot FileAccess
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement settings/registry replacement using ConfigFile with WCS-compatible API
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create DebugManager class routing to Godot print functions with log levels
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add system information functions using Godot OS singleton
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write cross-platform unit tests and validate on multiple operating systems

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test all utility functions with various inputs and edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Verify settings persistence and debug output in real usage scenarios
- **Manual Tests**: Cross-platform testing on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems

## Notes and Comments
This story focuses on leveraging Godot's excellent cross-platform capabilities rather than recreating WCS's custom platform abstraction. The goal is maximum compatibility with minimal custom code. Pay special attention to settings/registry behavior since WCS relies heavily on persistent configuration.
