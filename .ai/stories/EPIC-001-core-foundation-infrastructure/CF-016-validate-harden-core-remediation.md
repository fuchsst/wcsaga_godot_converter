# STORY-CF-016: Validate and Harden Core Foundation Remediation

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: CF-016
**Epic**: EPIC-001: Core Foundation & Infrastructure
**User Story**: As a lead developer, I want to rigorously validate and harden the implementations of critical remediation stories (CF-013, CF-014, CF-015), so that the project's core foundation is unequivocally stable, performant, and adheres to best practices before further development relies on it.
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimate**: 3-5 days
**Status**: READY
**Created**: 2025-06-07
**Updated**: 2025-06-07
**Depends On**: Assumed completion of initial implementations for CF-013, CF-014, CF-015.
**Blocks**: Full confidence in EPIC-001 completion.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The project configuration and dependency resolution (as per CF-013) is confirmed to be correct and allows the project to start without issues.
2.  The `ObjectManager` autoload (as per CF-014) is fully implemented, correctly registered, and its core functionalities are verified through targeted tests.
3.  The `VPResourceManager` (intended `vp_archive_loader.gd` from CF-015) is fully integrated and functional.
4.  `VPResourceManager` exclusively uses asynchronous loading mechanisms (e.g., `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()`) for loading VP archive contents to prevent game freezes.
5.  `VPResourceManager` implements robust error handling for scenarios such as corrupt archives, missing archive files, or missing files within archives, logging errors appropriately and preventing crashes.
6.  Performance metrics for VP archive loading meet acceptable standards (e.g., no noticeable hitches during dynamic loading).
7.  All code related to CF-013, CF-014, and CF-015 adheres to 100% static typing and project coding standards.

## Technical Requirements
1.  Review and test the implementation of CF-013, CF-014, and CF-015.
2.  Refactor `VPResourceManager` if necessary to ensure fully asynchronous operation and comprehensive error handling.
3.  Develop specific unit and integration tests for `ObjectManager` and `VPResourceManager` focusing on edge cases and error conditions.
4.  Profile VP archive loading to ensure performance targets are met.

## Implementation Details
-   **Validation of CF-013**:
    -   Verify `project.godot` settings.
    -   Test project startup on multiple platforms (if possible) or configurations.
-   **Validation of CF-014**:
    -   Create test scripts that utilize `ObjectManager` to register, retrieve, and manage mock objects.
    -   Verify singleton accessibility and correct initialization.
-   **Validation and Hardening of CF-015 (`VPResourceManager`)**:
    -   Audit `VPResourceManager` code for any synchronous `load()` or `preload()` calls related to archive data.
    -   Implement `try-catch` style error handling (or Godot equivalents like checking `FileAccess.get_open_error()`) for file operations.
    -   Simulate error conditions (e.g., by providing a path to a non-existent or malformed VP file) to test error handling.
    -   Implement asynchronous loading patterns using signals to notify completion or failure.

## Test Cases
1.  **TC-CF016-01**: Project starts successfully without configuration errors.
2.  **TC-CF016-02**: `ObjectManager` can be accessed globally and basic operations (e.g., `register_object`, `get_object`) function as expected.
3.  **TC-CF016-03**: `VPResourceManager` successfully loads a valid test VP archive asynchronously.
4.  **TC-CF016-04**: `VPResourceManager` handles a request to load a non-existent VP archive gracefully (e.g., logs error, returns null/error status).
5.  **TC-CF016-05**: `VPResourceManager` handles a request to load a corrupted VP archive gracefully.
6.  **TC-CF016-06**: Loading a large VP archive via `VPResourceManager` does not cause a noticeable stutter in a simulated game loop.

## WCS Reference
-   Original WCS stability during startup and asset loading.
-   Robustness of the original game's file system access.

## Godot Implementation Approach
-   Utilize `gdUnit4` for creating new unit tests.
-   Leverage Godot's `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()`, `await`, and signals for asynchronous operations.
-   Use Godot's built-in `FileAccess` for direct file operations if `VPResourceManager` handles raw files, ensuring error checks.
-   Employ Godot's logging mechanisms (`print_debug`, `push_error`, `push_warning`).

## Definition of Done
-   Code for CF-013, CF-014, CF-015 reviewed, and any necessary hardening changes implemented and reviewed.
-   `VPResourceManager` is confirmed to be fully asynchronous and handles errors robustly.
-   New unit/integration tests for `ObjectManager` and `VPResourceManager` are written and pass.
-   Performance of VP loading is validated.
-   Documentation for `VPResourceManager` error handling and async usage is updated if necessary.
-   Story validated by QA.

## Notes
-   This story focuses on ensuring the *quality and robustness* of the previously defined remediation stories. It may involve refactoring if the initial implementations are not up to par, especially regarding asynchronous operations and error handling in `VPResourceManager`.
