# User Story: Data Validation and Error Handling

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-012  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer ensuring data integrity during WCS conversion and runtime  
**I want**: Comprehensive data validation and error handling for all parsing and conversion operations  
**So that**: Data corruption is prevented, errors are caught early, and meaningful feedback is provided for debugging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: ValidationManager provides comprehensive validation rules for all WCS data types and formats
- [ ] **AC2**: Error reporting system gives detailed, actionable feedback for data validation failures
- [ ] **AC3**: Recovery mechanisms attempt to repair common data issues automatically with user notification
- [ ] **AC4**: Integration with EPIC-003 migration tools provides validation during batch conversion processes
- [ ] **AC5**: Runtime validation ensures data integrity during gameplay with graceful error handling
- [ ] **AC6**: Validation performance is optimized to minimize impact on parsing and loading operations

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Data Parsing Framework - Validation and Error Handling section
- **Godot Components**: Validation framework, error reporting system, integration with debug tools
- **Integration Points**: All parsing systems, EPIC-003 migration tools, asset pipeline, runtime data loading

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: WCS data validation patterns, error handling strategies from parsing systems
- **Godot Approach**: Comprehensive validation framework with integration to addon systems and migration tools
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing validation thoroughness with performance, providing meaningful error messages
- **Success Metrics**: All data corruption caught early, clear error messages for all failure cases

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-010 (Configuration Parser), CF-011 (Table Processor), EPIC-003 migration architecture
- **Blockers**: None - builds on parsing foundation
- **Related Stories**: All parsing and data systems benefit from this validation framework

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration with migration tools validated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance impact validated and optimized

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design validation framework architecture with rule-based validation system
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create ValidationManager with comprehensive validation rules for WCS data types
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement detailed error reporting system with actionable feedback
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add automatic recovery mechanisms for common data issues
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate with EPIC-003 migration tools for batch validation workflows
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement runtime validation for gameplay data integrity
- [ ] **Task 7**: Optimize validation performance to minimize parsing overhead
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive tests covering all validation scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test validation rules with various data inputs and error conditions
- **Integration Tests**: Verify validation integration with parsing and migration systems
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test error recovery and reporting mechanisms
- **Performance Tests**: Validate performance impact on parsing and loading operations

## Notes and Comments
Data validation is crucial for maintaining system stability and data integrity throughout the conversion process. Focus on providing clear, actionable error messages that help developers identify and fix issues quickly. The integration with migration tools ensures data quality from the start of the conversion workflow.
