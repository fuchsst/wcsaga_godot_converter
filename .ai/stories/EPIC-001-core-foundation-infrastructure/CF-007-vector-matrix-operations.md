# User Story: Vector and Matrix Operations

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-007  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer implementing WCS physics and 3D systems  
**I want**: Vector and matrix mathematical operations that match WCS precision and behavior  
**So that**: All physics calculations, transformations, and spatial operations produce identical results to the original game

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: WCSVector class provides all vector operations from WCS vecmat.cpp with identical precision
- [ ] **AC2**: WCSMatrix class implements matrix operations matching WCS transformation behavior exactly
- [ ] **AC3**: Mathematical functions maintain WCS precision standards for gameplay-critical calculations
- [ ] **AC4**: Godot integration allows seamless conversion between WCS types and Vector3/Transform3D
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance meets or exceeds original WCS implementation for common operations
- [ ] **AC6**: All mathematical edge cases (zero vectors, degenerate matrices) are handled correctly

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Mathematical Framework - Vector/Matrix Operations section
- **Godot Components**: Extension of Vector3, Basis, Transform3D with WCS-compatible operations
- **Integration Points**: Used by physics system, object transformations, collision detection, rendering

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/math/vecmat.cpp`, vector and matrix operation implementations
- **Godot Approach**: Wrapper classes that use Godot's optimized math while ensuring WCS precision
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining exact WCS precision while leveraging Godot's optimized implementations
- **Success Metrics**: All math operations produce bit-identical results to WCS reference implementation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (System Globals) for mathematical constants and precision settings
- **Blockers**: None - uses Godot built-in math systems
- **Related Stories**: CF-008 (Physics Math), CF-009 (Curve Math), all physics and rendering systems

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Mathematical precision validated against WCS reference
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking completed against WCS baseline

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS vecmat.cpp for all required vector and matrix operations
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create WCSVector class with all vector operations and Godot Vector3 integration
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create WCSMatrix class with matrix operations and Godot Basis/Transform3D integration
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement conversion functions between WCS and Godot mathematical types
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add precision testing and validation against WCS reference calculations
- [ ] **Task 6**: Optimize performance while maintaining mathematical accuracy
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive unit tests covering all operations and edge cases
- [ ] **Task 8**: Document mathematical specifications and usage examples

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test all vector/matrix operations with known inputs and expected outputs
- **Precision Tests**: Validate mathematical accuracy against WCS reference implementation
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark operation performance against Godot native and WCS baseline
- **Edge Case Tests**: Test degenerate cases, zero vectors, and numerical limits

## Notes and Comments
Mathematical accuracy is absolutely critical for gameplay feel and physics behavior. Focus on exact precision matching first, then optimize for performance. The integration with Godot's mathematical types should be seamless but never compromise WCS accuracy. Pay special attention to floating-point precision and rounding behavior.
