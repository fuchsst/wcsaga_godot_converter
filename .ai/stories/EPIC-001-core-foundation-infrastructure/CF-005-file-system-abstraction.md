# User Story: File System Abstraction Layer

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-005  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working with WCS file operations and asset management  
**I want**: A unified file system abstraction that handles both regular files and VP archives transparently  
**So that**: All WCS systems can access files consistently regardless of storage location (filesystem vs VP archive)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: FileManager class provides unified API for file operations (read, write, exists, list) across regular files and VP archives
- [ ] **AC2**: Path resolution system handles WCS-style paths and maps them to appropriate storage locations
- [ ] **AC3**: File operations are optimized with intelligent caching and minimal I/O overhead
- [ ] **AC4**: Error handling provides meaningful feedback for missing files, permission issues, and corruption
- [ ] **AC5**: FileUtils class offers generic file operation utilities (specific WCS file type handling belongs to other EPICs)
- [ ] **AC6**: Cross-platform compatibility ensures identical behavior on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: File System Foundation - File Manager and Path Utils sections
- **Godot Components**: FileAccess wrapper classes, path manipulation utilities
- **Integration Points**: Used by all systems requiring file access - asset loading, configuration, save/load

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/cfile/cfile.cpp`, `cfilesystem.cpp` for file operation patterns
- **Godot Approach**: Wrap Godot FileAccess with WCS-compatible API, leverage Godot's path utilities
- **Key Challenges**: Transparent VP archive integration, maintaining WCS path conventions, performance optimization
- **Success Metrics**: File operations perform equivalently to native Godot FileAccess, zero API friction

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-004 (VP Archive Loader) for archive file access, CF-002 (Platform Utils) for cross-platform support
- **Blockers**: None - builds on existing foundation components
- **Related Stories**: CF-006 (Resource Caching), all future file-dependent systems

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Performance validated against Godot FileAccess baseline

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS file operation patterns and requirements from cfile.cpp
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create FileManager class with unified file operation API
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement path resolution system for WCS-style paths
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add intelligent caching layer for frequently accessed files
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create FileUtils class with WCS-specific convenience functions
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add cross-platform testing and path resolution validation
- [ ] **Task 8**: Performance optimization and benchmarking against Godot baseline

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test file operations, path resolution, and error handling with various scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Verify VP archive integration and caching behavior
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark file operation performance against Godot FileAccess
- **Manual Tests**: Cross-platform file operation testing

## Notes and Comments
This abstraction layer is crucial for maintaining clean separation between file storage (VP vs filesystem) and file usage. Focus on making the API intuitive and performance-equivalent to Godot's native file operations. The path resolution system needs to handle WCS conventions while being Godot-friendly.
