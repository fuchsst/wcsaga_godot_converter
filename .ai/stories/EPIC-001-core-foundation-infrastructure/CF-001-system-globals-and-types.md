# User Story: System Globals and Type Definitions

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-001  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working on any WCS system conversion  
**I want**: A centralized system globals and type definitions framework  
**So that**: All WCS systems can reference consistent data types, constants, and global values matching the original C++ implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: WCSConstants resource class contains all global constants from `globals.h` and `pstypes.h` with identical values
- [ ] **AC2**: WCSTypes class provides type definitions and enums matching WCS C++ types with proper GDScript equivalents
- [ ] **AC3**: WCSPaths resource defines all standard game directory paths with cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] **AC4**: All type definitions use static typing and are properly documented with docstrings
- [ ] **AC5**: Constants are organized into logical groups (physics, rendering, gameplay, debug) for easy reference
- [ ] **AC6**: Type validation functions ensure data integrity when converting from C++ formats

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Foundation Layer Structure - Core Constants section
- **Godot Components**: Resource classes extending Godot's Resource base class
- **Integration Points**: Referenced by all other foundation systems and future WCS conversions

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/globalincs/globals.h`, `pstypes.h`, `systemvars.cpp`
- **Godot Approach**: Use Resource classes for data containers, proper enum definitions, static typing throughout
- **Key Challenges**: Ensuring C++ type equivalence while maintaining Godot best practices
- **Success Metrics**: All constants match WCS values exactly, type safety prevents runtime errors

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: None (foundation system)
- **Blockers**: Access to WCS source code for reference values
- **Related Stories**: All other CF stories depend on this foundational type system

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Values validated against original WCS source code

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Simple
- **Effort**: 1-2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS globals.h and pstypes.h for all required constants and types
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create WCSConstants resource class with organized constant groups
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create WCSTypes class with enum definitions and type conversion functions
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create WCSPaths resource with cross-platform path definitions
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement validation functions for type safety and data integrity
- [ ] **Task 6**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all type conversions and constants
- [ ] **Task 7**: Document all public APIs with usage examples

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Validate all constant values match WCS source, test type conversion functions
- **Integration Tests**: Verify other systems can access and use the global definitions correctly
- **Manual Tests**: Cross-platform path resolution testing on Windows/Linux/macOS

## Notes and Comments
**FOUNDATION SCOPE**: This story provides ONLY the core type definitions and constants framework. Specific usage of these types (ship data, weapon stats, etc.) belongs to other EPICs that will use this foundation.

This is the absolute foundation that everything else builds on. All constant values MUST match the original WCS implementation exactly to ensure behavioral compatibility. Focus on type safety and clear documentation since this will be referenced by every other system.
