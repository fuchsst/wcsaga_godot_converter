# User Story: Debug and Error Management System

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-003  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer debugging WCS system conversions  
**I want**: A comprehensive debug and error management system  
**So that**: I can quickly identify issues, track system performance, and maintain code quality during development and production

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: DebugManager autoload provides centralized logging with configurable levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
- [ ] **AC2**: Error handling system captures and reports all critical failures with stack traces and context
- [ ] **AC3**: Performance monitoring tracks frame time, memory usage, and system bottlenecks with real-time display
- [ ] **AC4**: Debug output can be filtered by system/component with runtime configuration
- [ ] **AC5**: Error recovery mechanisms attempt graceful degradation before system failure
- [ ] **AC6**: Debug information integrates with Godot's editor debug tools and remote debugging

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Foundation Layer Structure - Debug Manager section
- **Godot Components**: Autoload singleton, integration with Godot's print functions and debug tools
- **Integration Points**: Used by all WCS systems for error reporting and performance monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/osapi/outwnd.cpp`, debug output systems, error handling patterns
- **Godot Approach**: Extend Godot's built-in debugging with WCS-specific monitoring and error recovery
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing debug detail with performance, integrating with Godot's existing debug tools
- **Success Metrics**: Zero critical errors go undetected, debug overhead <1% of frame time

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (System Globals) for debug constants, CF-002 (Platform Utils) for file operations
- **Blockers**: None - extends Godot built-in debugging
- **Related Stories**: All CF stories will use this debug system for development and validation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Performance impact testing completed (<1% overhead)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Integration with Godot editor tools validated

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze WCS debug output patterns and error handling requirements
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create DebugManager autoload with configurable logging levels and filtering
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement error capture system with stack traces and context information
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add performance monitoring for frame time, memory usage, and system metrics
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create error recovery mechanisms with graceful degradation strategies
- [ ] **Task 6**: Integrate with Godot's editor debugging tools and remote debugging
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement runtime configuration for debug levels and output filtering
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive tests and validate performance impact

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test logging functions, error capture, and recovery mechanisms
- **Integration Tests**: Verify debug system works correctly with other foundation components
- **Performance Tests**: Measure debug system overhead and validate <1% impact target
- **Manual Tests**: Test integration with Godot editor and remote debugging tools

## Notes and Comments
This debug system is critical for development productivity and production stability. Focus on making it easy to use while maintaining excellent performance. The integration with Godot's existing tools is important for developer workflow. Consider implementing debug visualization tools for complex systems.
