# User Story: VP Archive ResourceLoader Implementation

**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Story ID**: CF-004  
**Created**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer loading WCS assets and content  
**I want**: Seamless VP archive integration with Godot's ResourceLoader system  
**So that**: All WCS assets (models, textures, sounds, data) can be loaded transparently through Godot's standard resource loading mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Custom ResourceLoader plugin handles .vp files and integrates with `load()` and `preload()` functions
- [ ] **AC2**: VP archive files are parsed correctly with full file table extraction and validation
- [ ] **AC3**: Individual files within VP archives can be accessed using standard Godot resource paths
- [ ] **AC4**: ResourceLoader provides generic file extraction from VP archives (specific file type handling belongs to other EPICs)
- [ ] **AC5**: Archive loading performance meets target of <2 seconds for largest WCS VP files
- [ ] **AC6**: Memory usage is optimized with lazy loading - files loaded only when requested

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: File System Foundation - VP Archive ResourceLoader section
- **Godot Components**: Custom ResourceLoader implementation, FileAccess for binary data reading
- **Integration Points**: Core foundation for all asset loading systems across WCS conversion

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/cfile/cfilearchive.cpp`, VP file format documentation
- **Godot Approach**: Implement ResourceLoader interface with VP format parsing, integrate with Godot's resource caching
- **Key Challenges**: Binary VP format parsing, efficient file table indexing, handling nested archive structures
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS VP files load successfully, asset access performance equivalent to regular files

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (System Globals) for file format constants, CF-002 (Platform Utils) for file operations
- **Blockers**: Access to WCS VP archive files for testing and validation
- **Related Stories**: CF-005 (File System Abstraction), all future asset loading systems

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Performance testing with real WCS VP files completed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs)
- [ ] Integration with Godot ResourceLoader system validated

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze VP file format specification and WCS cfilearchive.cpp implementation
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create VPArchiveLoader class implementing ResourceLoader interface
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement VP file header parsing and file table extraction
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add binary data reading and file extraction functionality
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate with Godot's resource caching and path resolution systems
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement lazy loading and memory optimization
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create comprehensive test suite with real WCS VP archives
- [ ] **Task 8**: Performance optimization and validation against target metrics

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test VP parsing functions with various archive formats and edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Verify ResourceLoader integration and file access through Godot APIs
- **Performance Tests**: Load real WCS VP archives and measure performance metrics
- **Manual Tests**: Test asset loading in actual game scenarios

## Notes and Comments
**FOUNDATION SCOPE**: This story provides ONLY the VP archive extraction infrastructure. Specific file type processing (POF models, textures, sounds) belongs to other EPICs that will use this foundation.

This is one of the most critical and complex stories in the foundation. VP archives are the primary asset delivery mechanism for WCS, so this system must be rock-solid and performant. Focus on correctness first, then optimize for performance. The integration with Godot's ResourceLoader is essential for seamless asset pipeline.
