# User Story: Briefing Editor System

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-007  
**Created**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer creating immersive mission briefings  
**I want**: A comprehensive briefing editor that recreates the FRED2 briefing system  
**So that**: I can create engaging mission briefings with camera movements, animations, and voice integration

## WCS Source Analysis Reference
**C++ Implementation**: `briefingeditordlg.cpp` (1,000+ lines), `cmdbrief.cpp`  
**Key Features**: Multi-stage briefings, camera positioning, icon animations, voice-over integration, timeline editing  
**Complexity**: High - requires 3D camera control, animation system, audio synchronization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Multi-stage briefing creation with timeline-based editing interface
- [ ] **AC2**: 3D camera positioning and movement system for briefing viewpoints
- [ ] **AC3**: Briefing icon placement with ship/target/objective markers
- [ ] **AC4**: Animation system for icon movement and camera transitions
- [ ] **AC5**: Voice-over file integration with timeline synchronization
- [ ] **AC6**: Text overlay system with formatting and timing controls
- [ ] **AC7**: Real-time briefing preview with playback controls
- [ ] **AC8**: Briefing export to game-compatible format
- [ ] **AC9**: Integration with mission asset system for ship/location references
- [ ] **AC10**: Performance optimization for complex briefings (60+ FPS preview)

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md` Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**
- **3D Integration**: Use existing GFRED2 3D viewport system for camera positioning with scene-based components
- **Asset Integration**: Leverage EPIC-002 asset system for ship models and textures
- **Audio System**: Integration with Godot's audio system for voice-over playback
- **Timeline System**: Scene-based custom timeline editor for briefing sequence management (`addons/gfred2/scenes/components/`)
- **Export Format**: Compatible with WCS briefing file format using EPIC-003 conversion tools
- **Performance**: < 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS real-time preview

## Implementation Notes
- **Critical Mission Feature**: Briefings are essential for mission storytelling and player guidance
- **Complex UI Requirements**: Multi-panel interface with 3D viewport, timeline, and property editors
- **Performance Critical**: Real-time preview must maintain smooth playback
- **Asset Dependencies**: Requires full integration with ship models and audio assets

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-001 (Asset Integration), GFRED2-004 (Core Infrastructure)
- **Blockers**: None - foundation systems provide necessary capabilities
- **Related Stories**: Enhances mission creation with essential storytelling capabilities

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Multi-stage briefing editor with intuitive timeline interface
- [ ] 3D camera system with smooth movement and positioning controls
- [ ] Icon placement system with comprehensive marker types
- [ ] Animation editor for icon movement and camera transitions
- [ ] Voice-over integration with precise timeline synchronization
- [ ] Text overlay system with rich formatting capabilities
- [ ] Real-time preview maintaining 60+ FPS performance
- [ ] Export system generating WCS-compatible briefing files
- [ ] Asset integration working seamlessly with ship models and textures
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with complex multi-stage briefings

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 5 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design scene-based briefing editor UI with timeline and 3D viewport integration (`scenes/dialogs/briefing_editor_dialog.tscn`)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement 3D camera positioning and movement system
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create briefing icon placement and management system
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build animation system for icon movement and camera transitions
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate voice-over system with timeline synchronization
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement text overlay system with formatting controls
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create real-time briefing preview with playback controls
- [ ] **Task 8**: Build briefing export system using EPIC-003 conversion tools
- [ ] **Task 9**: Optimize performance for smooth real-time preview
- [ ] **Task 10**: Comprehensive testing with various briefing scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Integration Tests**: Test briefing editor with complex multi-stage scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Validate real-time preview performance with large briefings
- **Asset Tests**: Verify integration with ship models and audio assets
- **Export Tests**: Ensure briefing export compatibility with WCS game engine

## Notes and Comments
**CRITICAL FEATURE GAP**: This story addresses one of the most significant gaps identified by Larry's analysis. The briefing editor is essential for professional mission creation and was completely missing from the original story set.

Key capabilities from WCS FRED2:
- Multi-stage briefing management
- 3D camera control and positioning
- Icon placement and animation
- Voice-over integration and synchronization
- Real-time preview and testing

This briefing system enables mission creators to craft engaging, cinematic briefings that immerse players in the mission narrative.
