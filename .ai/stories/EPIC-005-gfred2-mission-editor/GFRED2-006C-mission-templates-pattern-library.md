# User Story: Mission Templates and Pattern Library

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-006C  
**Created**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer who needs to create missions efficiently and follow best practices  
**I want**: A comprehensive library of mission templates and common patterns  
**So that**: I can quickly start new missions and apply proven design patterns for consistent quality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Mission template library with pre-configured scenarios (escort, patrol, assault, etc.)
- [ ] **AC2**: SEXP pattern library with common scripting solutions and best practices
- [ ] **AC3**: Asset pattern library with standard ship configurations and weapon loadouts
- [ ] **AC4**: Template customization system allows modification before mission creation
- [ ] **AC5**: Pattern insertion system adds common elements to existing missions
- [ ] **AC6**: Template and pattern validation ensures compatibility with current asset library
- [ ] **AC7**: Community template sharing system for user-contributed patterns
- [ ] **AC8**: Template documentation provides usage guidance and best practices

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md` Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**
- **ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE**: ALL UI components MUST be centralized scenes in `addons/gfred2/scenes/` structure
- **Asset Integration**: Templates use EPIC-002 asset system for compatibility validation
- **SEXP Integration**: Pattern library leverages EPIC-004 SEXP system for complex logic
- **Template Engine**: Flexible template system supporting parameterization and customization (< 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS UI updates)
- **Validation**: Template compatibility checking using integrated validation systems
- **UI Architecture**: Template library uses ONLY centralized scene structure from `addons/gfred2/scenes/dialogs/template_library/`
- **Pattern UI**: Pattern insertion interface ONLY from `addons/gfred2/scenes/components/pattern_browser/`
- **NO MIXED APPROACHES**: Eliminate any programmatic UI construction, use scene-based architecture exclusively

## Implementation Notes
- **Productivity Enhancement**: Accelerates mission creation through proven patterns
- **Quality Consistency**: Promotes best practices through validated templates
- **Learning Tool**: Helps new mission designers learn effective techniques
- **Community Features**: Enables sharing and collaboration on mission patterns

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-001, GFRED2-002, GFRED2-003 (asset, SEXP, and file integration)
- **Blockers**: None - builds on complete integration foundation
- **Related Stories**: Enhances productivity for all mission creation workflows

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Mission template library with at least 10 common scenario types
- [ ] SEXP pattern library with 20+ validated scripting solutions
- [ ] Asset pattern library with standard configurations for all ship types
- [ ] Template customization interface for parameter adjustment before creation
- [ ] Pattern insertion system for adding elements to existing missions
- [ ] Template validation ensures compatibility with current asset and SEXP systems
- [ ] Community template system for sharing user-contributed patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for all templates and patterns

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 4 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design template data structure and storage system
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create mission template library with common scenario types
- [ ] **Task 3**: Build SEXP pattern library with validated scripting solutions
- [ ] **Task 4**: Develop asset pattern library with standard ship/weapon configurations
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement template customization interface with parameter controls
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create pattern insertion system for existing missions
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add template validation using integrated asset and SEXP systems
- [ ] **Task 8**: Build community template sharing and documentation system

## Testing Strategy
- **Template Tests**: Validate all templates create functional missions
- **Pattern Tests**: Ensure SEXP patterns work correctly in various contexts
- **Integration Tests**: Test template system with all integrated foundation systems
- **User Experience Tests**: Validate template workflow enhances productivity

## Notes and Comments
**PRODUCTIVITY MULTIPLIER**: This story dramatically accelerates mission creation by providing a comprehensive library of validated templates and patterns that leverage all integrated foundation systems.

Key template categories:
- **Mission Types**: Escort, patrol, assault, defense, stealth, rescue scenarios
- **SEXP Patterns**: Common triggers, objectives, AI behaviors, event sequences
- **Asset Patterns**: Standard ship loadouts, wing formations, weapon configurations
- **Advanced Patterns**: Complex multi-stage missions, dynamic objectives, branching storylines

The template system serves as both a productivity tool and a learning resource, helping mission designers understand best practices while accelerating development.
