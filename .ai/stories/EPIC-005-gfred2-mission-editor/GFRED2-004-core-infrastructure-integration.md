# User Story: Core Infrastructure Integration with EPIC-001

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-004  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Ready  
**Updated**: May 31, 2025

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer maintaining the GFRED2 mission editor  
**I want**: GFRED2 to systematically integrate with EPIC-001 core infrastructure utilities  
**So that**: The codebase eliminates technical debt, follows project standards, and leverages proven foundational systems

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Math operations use core utilities (Vector3D, Matrix4x4, collision detection, spatial queries)
- [ ] **AC2**: File operations use core abstraction (VP archives, cross-platform paths, resource loading)
- [ ] **AC3**: Error handling follows standardized patterns with consistent validation and recovery
- [ ] **AC4**: Configuration system integrated (user preferences, editor settings, keyboard shortcuts)
- [ ] **AC5**: Resource management uses core patterns (memory management, asset caching, cleanup)
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance optimizations leverage core utilities (threading, profiling, optimization hints)
- [ ] **AC7**: All custom utility functions removed or migrated to core foundation
- [ ] **AC8**: Integration tests validate performance and functionality parity
- [ ] **AC9**: The legacy `input_manager.gd` is removed, and all input handling is standardized on `GFRED2ShortcutManager`.

## Technical Requirements
**Architecture Reference**: .ai/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**

- **Math Integration**: Replace custom math in `viewport/`, `object_management/` with core utilities
- **File System Migration**: Update mission file operations to use core VP archive access
- **Error Handling**: Implement standardized error patterns across all GFRED2 components with scene-based architecture
- **Configuration**: Integrate user settings with core configuration management using `addons/gfred2/scenes/dialogs/preferences/` (FOUNDATION COMPLETE via GFRED2-011)
- **Performance**: Apply core optimization patterns to viewport rendering and object manipulation (< 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS UI updates)
- **Memory Management**: Use core resource management for large mission data sets with centralized scene structure (ARCHITECTURE ESTABLISHED)
- **Scene-Based Implementation**: Leverage established scene architecture patterns from UI refactoring

## Implementation Notes
- **Code Quality**: Improves maintainability through standardization
- **Performance**: Leverage optimized core utilities
- **Consistency**: Ensures GFRED2 follows project-wide patterns
- **Maintenance**: Reduces duplicate utility code

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-001 Core Foundation Infrastructure (completed) ✅  
- **Foundation Dependencies**: GFRED2-011 (UI Refactoring) - **COMPLETED** ✅  
- **Blockers**: None - All foundation systems complete with scene-based architecture  
- **Related Stories**: Improves overall code quality and maintainability  
- **Implementation Ready**: Scene-based UI foundation established for infrastructure integration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Custom math utilities removed from `viewport/mission_camera_3d.gd` and `object_management/`
- [ ] File operations in `mission/fs2_parser.gd` use core VP archive utilities
- [ ] Error handling in all dialogs follows core validation patterns
- [ ] User preferences and editor settings use core configuration system
- [ ] Resource management for mission data uses core memory patterns
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained or improved (viewport FPS, object manipulation speed)
- [ ] Integration tests validate all core utility usage
- [ ] No duplicate utility code remains in GFRED2 codebase

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Audit and map GFRED2 utility functions to core foundation equivalents
- [ ] **Task 2**: Replace viewport math operations (`mission_camera_3d.gd`, gizmos) with core utilities
- [ ] **Task 3**: Migrate file operations in `mission/` directory to core VP archive access
- [ ] **Task 4**: Update error handling across all dialogs to use core validation patterns
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate editor settings and user preferences with core configuration
- [ ] **Task 6**: Apply core resource management patterns to mission data handling
- [ ] **Task 7**: Remove duplicate utility functions and update all references
- [ ] **Task 8**: Create performance benchmarks and validate integration maintains performance
- [ ] **Task 9**: Deprecate and remove `input_manager.gd`, refactoring all its usages in `editor_main.gd` and other UI components to use `GFRED2ShortcutManager`.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test integration with core utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Validate error handling and file operations
- **Code Quality Tests**: Ensure no duplicate utility code remains
- **Performance Tests**: Verify core utilities maintain performance

## Notes and Comments
**MAINTENANCE IMPROVEMENT**: This story reduces technical debt by eliminating duplicate code and ensuring GFRED2 follows project-wide standards.

Key areas for integration:
- Vector/matrix math operations for 3D editing
- File system abstraction for cross-platform compatibility
- Error handling and validation patterns
- Resource management and caching

Focus on incremental migration to minimize risk while improving code quality.
