# User Story: Mission File Conversion Integration with EPIC-003

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-003  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer working with existing WCS missions  
**I want**: GFRED2 to seamlessly import and export missions using EPIC-003 conversion tools  
**So that**: I can edit existing WCS missions and export them in compatible formats

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: GFRED2 uses `wcs_converter` addon for FS2 mission file import/export
- [ ] **AC2**: Mission import preserves all WCS mission data including SEXP expressions
- [ ] **AC3**: Mission export generates compatible FS2 mission files
- [ ] **AC4**: Import process provides progress feedback and error handling
- [ ] **AC5**: Export validation ensures mission compatibility before saving
- [ ] **AC6**: Batch import/export operations are supported
- [ ] **AC7**: Tests validate round-trip conversion (import → edit → export)

## Technical Requirements
- **Integration**: Use `MissionConverter` from `addons/wcs_converter/`
- **Replace**: Custom FS2 parser with standardized conversion system
- **Update**: File dialogs to use conversion system progress tracking
- **Enhancement**: Add validation and error reporting for mission files

## Implementation Notes
- **Standardization**: Eliminates duplicate mission file handling code
- **Enhanced Features**: Gains comprehensive conversion capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Better validation and error reporting for mission files
- **Performance**: Leverage optimized conversion algorithms

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-003 Data Migration & Conversion Tools (completed)
- **Blockers**: None - EPIC-003 conversion tools are complete
- **Related Stories**: Enables mission workflow with existing WCS content

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Custom mission parser removed from GFRED2
- [ ] Mission import uses `wcs_converter` with full feature set
- [ ] Mission export generates valid FS2 files compatible with WCS
- [ ] Progress tracking and error handling works correctly
- [ ] Batch operations supported for multiple mission files
- [ ] Round-trip conversion tests pass with high fidelity
- [ ] All mission editing workflows support converted missions

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Remove custom FS2 parser from GFRED2 (`mission/fs2_parser.gd`)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Update mission import to use `MissionConverter` from `wcs_converter`
- [ ] **Task 3**: Update mission export to use standardized conversion system
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement progress tracking and error handling for conversion operations
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add mission validation before export using conversion tools
- [ ] **Task 6**: Support batch import/export operations
- [ ] **Task 7**: Write comprehensive tests for mission conversion workflows

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test mission import/export with various FS2 files
- **Integration Tests**: Test round-trip conversion fidelity
- **User Experience Tests**: Validate file operation workflow and error handling
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure conversion performance meets requirements

## Notes and Comments
**STANDARDIZATION CRITICAL**: This story eliminates duplicate mission file handling and ensures consistency with the project's conversion standards.

The conversion system provides enhanced capabilities:
- Comprehensive FS2 format support
- Advanced error detection and recovery
- Progress tracking for large operations
- Validation and compatibility checking

Focus on seamless integration while maintaining existing user workflows.
