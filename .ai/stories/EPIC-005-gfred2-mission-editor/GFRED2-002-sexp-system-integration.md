**Updated**: May 31, 2025

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer creating complex mission logic  
**I want**: GFRED2 to use the comprehensive EPIC-004 SEXP system for visual scripting  
**So that**: I can create complex mission events with full validation, debugging, and all available functions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC2**: Visual SEXP editing provides access to all EPIC-004 functions and operators
- [ ] **AC3**: SEXP validation and debugging tools are available in mission editor
- [ ] **AC4**: Mission events, goals, and triggers use standardized SEXP expressions
- [ ] **AC5**: Property editors for SEXP fields use core SEXP input controls
- [ ] **AC6**: SEXP expressions can be saved/loaded with mission files correctly
- [ ] **AC7**: SEXP debug features (breakpoints, variable watching) work in mission editor context
- [ ] **AC8**: Migration path preserves existing custom SEXP nodes and expressions
- [ ] **AC9**: AI-powered fix suggestions from EPIC-004 integrated into editor UI
- [ ] **AC10**: Performance maintained for complex SEXP trees (>60 FPS with 100+ nodes)
- [ ] **AC11**: Tests validate integration with complete SEXP system including debug features
- [ ] **AC12**: Variable management UI integrated for creating and monitoring SEXP variables
- [ ] **AC13**: SEXP tools palette with function browser and quick insertion capabilities

## Technical Requirements
**Architecture Reference**: .ai/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**

- **Remove**: Basic SEXP implementation from `gfred2/sexp_editor/`
- **Replace**: SEXP graph editor with integration to `addons/sexp/`
- **Migration**: Preserve existing SEXP editor UI while upgrading backend functionality
- **Debug Integration**: Integrate `SexpValidator`, `SexpDebugEvaluator` from EPIC-004 debug framework
- **Performance**: Maintain SEXP editor responsiveness with large expression trees (< 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS UI updates)
- **UI Enhancement**: Add debug panels, variable watch, and AI-powered suggestions using scene-based architecture
- **Variable Management**: Integrate variable creation and monitoring UI from `addons/gfred2/scenes/dialogs/sexp_editor/` (FOUNDATION COMPLETE via GFRED2-011)
- **SEXP Tools**: Add function browser, quick insertion using centralized scene structure from `addons/gfred2/scenes/components/sexp_palette/` (ARCHITECTURE ESTABLISHED)
- **Scene-Based Implementation**: Leverage established scene architecture patterns from UI refactoring

## Implementation Notes
- **Major Integration**: This connects GFRED2 with the complete SEXP system
- **Enhanced Features**: Gains access to debugging, validation, and full function library
- **UI Integration**: SEXP editor becomes more sophisticated with debug capabilities
- **Performance**: Leverage SEXP system's performance optimizations

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-004 SEXP Expression System (completed) ✅  
- **Foundation Dependencies**: GFRED2-011 (UI Refactoring) - **COMPLETED** ✅  
- **Blockers**: None - All foundation systems complete with scene-based architecture  
- **Related Stories**: Enables advanced mission scripting workflows  
- **Implementation Ready**: Scene-based UI foundation established for SEXP editor

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Custom SEXP parser (`sexp_editor/sexp_graph.gd`) migrated to core system
- [ ] All SEXP operations use core `SexpManager` and evaluation system
- [ ] Visual SEXP editor works with core SEXP tree structures and validation
- [ ] Real-time validation integrated with AI-powered fix suggestions
- [ ] Debug tools (breakpoints, variable watch) accessible from mission editor
- [ ] Migration preserves all existing SEXP expressions and custom nodes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained (>60 FPS with 100+ SEXP nodes)
- [ ] UI integration seamless with existing mission editor workflow
- [ ] Mission save/load preserves SEXP expressions correctly
- [ ] All SEXP editing workflows tested with complex mission scenarios

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 5 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create migration strategy for existing SEXP editor backend to core system
- [ ] **Task 2**: Update visual SEXP editor to use core `SexpManager` while preserving UI
- [ ] **Task 3**: Integrate core function registry with existing SEXP node palette
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add real-time validation with AI-powered fix suggestions to editor UI
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate debug framework (SexpValidator, SexpDebugEvaluator) into editor
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add debug panels for breakpoints, variable watching, and expression testing
- [ ] **Task 7**: Performance optimization for large SEXP trees using core caching
- [ ] **Task 8**: Migration testing with existing GFRED2 missions and custom expressions
- [ ] **Task 9**: UI testing for seamless integration with mission editor workflow

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test SEXP editor integration with core system
- **Integration Tests**: Test mission events with SEXP expressions
- **User Experience Tests**: Validate SEXP editing workflow with debug features
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure SEXP evaluation performance in mission context

## Notes and Comments
**FEATURE ENHANCEMENT**: This story significantly upgrades GFRED2's scripting capabilities by integrating with the complete SEXP system that includes debugging, validation, and comprehensive function libraries.

The SEXP system provides advanced features like:
- AI-powered fix suggestions
- Step-through debugging
- Variable watching
- Expression tree visualization
- Performance optimization

Focus on seamless integration while gaining access to all these advanced features.
