# User Story: Campaign Editor Integration

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-008  
**Created**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: Ready  
**Updated**: May 31, 2025  
**Priority**: High (Phase 4 Critical Feature Parity)

## Story Definition
**As a**: Campaign designer creating multi-mission storylines  
**I want**: A comprehensive campaign editor integrated with the mission editor  
**So that**: I can create complex campaigns with branching storylines, persistent variables, and mission prerequisites

## WCS Source Analysis Reference
**C++ Implementation**: `campaigneditordlg.cpp`, `campaigntreeview.cpp`, `campaigntreewnd.cpp`, `campaignfilelistbox.cpp`  
**Key Features**: Campaign structure, mission branching, prerequisite management, campaign-wide variables, mission flow visualization  
**Complexity**: High - requires tree visualization, dependency management, campaign scripting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Campaign structure editor with visual mission flow diagram
- [ ] **AC2**: Mission prerequisite and branching logic configuration
- [ ] **AC3**: Campaign-wide variable management and persistence
- [ ] **AC4**: Mission unlocking and progression system
- [ ] **AC5**: Campaign briefing and debriefing integration
- [ ] **AC6**: Campaign testing and validation tools
- [ ] **AC7**: Campaign export to game-compatible format
- [ ] **AC8**: Integration with individual mission editor for seamless workflow
- [ ] **AC9**: Campaign statistics and progress tracking
- [ ] **AC10**: Performance optimization for large campaigns (50+ missions)

## Technical Requirements
**Architecture Reference**: .ai/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**

- **Mission Integration**: Seamless integration with individual mission editing workflow using scene-based architecture
- **Dependency Management**: Complex prerequisite and branching logic system (< 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS UI updates)
- **Variable System**: Campaign-wide variable persistence using EPIC-004 SEXP system
- **Visualization**: Interactive campaign flow diagram with drag-drop mission organization from `addons/gfred2/scenes/dialogs/campaign_editor/` (ARCHITECTURE ESTABLISHED via GFRED2-011)
- **Export Format**: Compatible with WCS campaign file format using EPIC-003 conversion tools
- **UI Architecture**: Campaign editor uses centralized scene structure from `addons/gfred2/scenes/main/campaign_editor.tscn` (FOUNDATION COMPLETE)
- **Architectural Compliance**: UI refactoring provides clean scene-based foundation for campaign editor components

## Implementation Notes
- **Essential Feature**: Campaigns are critical for multi-mission storylines and player progression
- **Complex Dependencies**: Requires sophisticated dependency tracking between missions
- **Variable Scope**: Campaign variables must integrate with mission-level SEXP variables
- **Testing Challenges**: Campaign testing requires mission sequence validation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-002 (SEXP Integration), GFRED2-003 (Mission Conversion), GFRED2-007 (Briefing Editor) - **FOUNDATION READY**  
- **Critical Foundation**: GFRED2-011 (UI Refactoring) - **COMPLETED** âœ…  
- **Blockers**: None - All foundation systems complete with scene-based architecture  
- **Related Stories**: Builds on mission editing to create complete campaign development workflow  
- **Implementation Ready**: Scene-based campaign editor UI foundation established

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Campaign structure editor with intuitive visual mission flow interface
- [ ] Mission prerequisite system with complex branching logic support
- [ ] Campaign-wide variable management integrated with SEXP system
- [ ] Mission unlocking and progression system with validation
- [ ] Campaign briefing and debriefing editors integrated
- [ ] Campaign testing tools with mission sequence validation
- [ ] Export system generating WCS-compatible campaign files
- [ ] Seamless integration with individual mission editor workflow
- [ ] Campaign statistics dashboard and progress tracking
- [ ] Performance optimized for large campaigns with many missions

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 4 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design campaign editor UI with visual mission flow diagram
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement mission prerequisite and branching logic system
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create campaign-wide variable management system
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build mission unlocking and progression mechanics
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate campaign briefing and debriefing systems
- [ ] **Task 6**: Develop campaign testing and validation tools
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create campaign export system using EPIC-003 conversion tools
- [ ] **Task 8**: Ensure seamless integration with mission editor workflow
- [ ] **Task 9**: Add campaign statistics and progress tracking features
- [ ] **Task 10**: Optimize performance for large campaign management

## Testing Strategy
- **Integration Tests**: Test campaign editor with complex multi-mission scenarios
- **Dependency Tests**: Validate prerequisite and branching logic accuracy
- **Variable Tests**: Ensure campaign-wide variable persistence and SEXP integration
- **Export Tests**: Verify campaign export compatibility with WCS game engine

## Notes and Comments
**CRITICAL FEATURE GAP**: This story addresses the complete absence of campaign creation capabilities identified by Larry's analysis. Campaign editing is essential for creating the multi-mission storylines that define the WCS experience.

Key capabilities from WCS FRED2:
- Visual campaign structure editing
- Mission prerequisite and branching logic
- Campaign-wide variable management
- Mission unlocking and progression
- Campaign testing and validation

This campaign system enables mission creators to build complex, interconnected storylines that provide rich gameplay experiences across multiple missions.
