# User Story: Advanced SEXP Debugging Integration

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-006B  
**Created**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: Completed  
**Completed**: May 31, 2025  
**Updated**: May 31, 2025  
**Priority**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer creating complex mission logic with intricate SEXP expressions  
**I want**: Advanced SEXP debugging capabilities integrated directly into the mission editor  
**So that**: I can test, debug, and optimize mission scripts without leaving the editor environment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: SEXP breakpoint system integrated into mission editor with visual indicators
- [ ] **AC2**: Variable watch system tracks mission variables in real-time during testing
- [ ] **AC3**: Step-through debugging allows inspection of SEXP execution flow
- [ ] **AC4**: Expression evaluation preview shows SEXP results before mission testing
- [ ] **AC5**: Debug console provides interactive SEXP expression testing
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance profiling identifies slow SEXP expressions and optimization opportunities
- [ ] **AC7**: Debug session management with save/restore of debug configurations
- [ ] **AC8**: Integration with mission testing allows live debugging of running missions

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md` Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**
- **MANDATORY SCENE-BASED UI**: ALL debug UI components MUST be scenes in `addons/gfred2/scenes/components/` (NO programmatic UI)
- **EPIC-004 Integration**: Full utilization of `SexpDebugEvaluator`, `SexpVariableWatchSystem` with scene-based controllers
- **UI Integration**: Scene-based debug panels ONLY in centralized `addons/gfred2/scenes/` structure (ARCHITECTURE ESTABLISHED via GFRED2-011)
- **Performance**: Debug features available without impacting editor performance (< 16ms scene instantiation, 60 FPS UI)
- **Session Management**: Persistent debug configurations per mission with scene-based configuration UI (FOUNDATION COMPLETE)
- **Architectural Compliance**: UI refactoring provides clean scene-based foundation for debug components

## Implementation Notes
- **Professional Debugging**: Brings IDE-level debugging to mission scripting
- **Seamless Integration**: Debug features feel native to mission editor workflow
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Live debugging during mission testing
- **Performance Awareness**: Profiling helps optimize mission performance

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-002 (SEXP Integration) - **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**  
- **Critical Foundation**: GFRED2-011 (UI Refactoring) - **COMPLETED** ✅  
- **Blockers**: None - EPIC-004 debug framework complete, scene-based architecture established  
- **Related Stories**: Builds on SEXP integration for advanced capabilities  
- **Implementation Ready**: Scene-based debug UI components can be implemented immediately

## Definition of Done
- [ ] SEXP breakpoint system integrated with visual breakpoint indicators
- [ ] Variable watch panels show real-time variable values during debugging
- [ ] Step-through debugging controls integrated into mission editor UI
- [ ] Expression preview evaluates SEXP expressions without full mission execution
- [ ] Debug console allows interactive testing of SEXP functions and variables
- [ ] Performance profiling identifies and reports slow SEXP expressions
- [ ] Debug session configurations saved and restored per mission
- [ ] Live debugging works with mission testing and simulation

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Integrate `SexpDebugEvaluator` into mission editor debug interface
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create visual breakpoint system for SEXP expressions in editor
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement variable watch panels with real-time value updates
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add step-through debugging controls and execution visualization
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create expression preview system for immediate SEXP evaluation
- [ ] **Task 6**: Integrate debug console for interactive SEXP testing
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add performance profiling with optimization suggestions
- [ ] **Task 8**: Implement debug session management and configuration persistence

## Testing Strategy
- **Debug Workflow Tests**: Test complete debugging workflows with complex missions
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure debug features don't impact editor performance
- **Integration Tests**: Validate debugging with live mission testing
- **User Experience Tests**: Ensure debugging enhances mission development workflow

## Notes and Comments
**PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TOOL**: This story transforms GFRED2 into a professional mission development environment by providing IDE-level debugging capabilities for SEXP expressions.

Key debugging features:
- Visual breakpoint management in SEXP expressions
- Real-time variable monitoring and inspection
- Step-through debugging with execution flow visualization
- Performance profiling for mission optimization
- Interactive testing environment

This builds directly on the EPIC-004 debug framework to provide a comprehensive mission scripting development environment.
