# User Story: Integrate Real-time Validation into GFRED2 UI

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor
**Story ID**: GFRED2-018
**Created**: June 7, 2025
**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: Medium

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission Designer
**I want**: To see real-time validation warnings and errors directly in the GFRED2 editor as I work
**So that**: I can identify and fix issues immediately, improving my workflow and the quality of the missions I create.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: The `ValidationDock` is updated to automatically run validation checks in the background as the mission is edited.
- [ ] **AC2**: Validation results (errors and warnings) are displayed in the `ValidationDock` in real-time.
- [ ] **AC3**: UI elements in the editor (e.g., in the `ObjectInspectorDock` or the mission hierarchy) visually indicate when they are associated with a validation issue (e.g., a red icon next to a ship with an invalid configuration).
- [ ] **AC4**: Clicking on a validation issue in the `ValidationDock` navigates the user to the relevant object or setting in the editor.
- [ ] **AC5**: The real-time validation system is performant and does not noticeably impact the editor's responsiveness.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: This story enhances the user experience as envisioned in `.ai/docs/EPIC-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md`. It leverages the existing `validation_framework`.
- **Implementation**:
    - The `ValidationDock` (`target/addons/gfred2/scenes/docks/validation_dock.tscn`) and its controller will need to be updated to trigger validation checks.
    - A background thread or a `Timer` node should be used to run validation periodically without blocking the UI.
    - A signal-based system should be used to communicate validation results to the relevant UI components.
    - UI components will need to be updated to listen for these signals and display validation indicators.

## Implementation Notes
- **User Experience**: This feature is crucial for creating a modern, user-friendly editor.
- **Performance**: The validation process must be optimized to run quickly in the background. Consider validating only the changed parts of the mission data to improve performance.

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: A functional `validation_framework` and the core UI docks (`ValidationDock`, `ObjectInspectorDock`) must be in place.
- **Blockers**: None.
- **Related Stories**: GFRED2-015 (Refactor editor_main.gd) will make it easier to integrate this system by providing clearer points of connection.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] The `ValidationDock` displays real-time validation results.
- [ ] UI components visually indicate validation issues.
- [ ] The system is performant and does not degrade the editor experience.
- [ ] All tests related to the validation UI pass.

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium (performance is a key concern)
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Modify `ValidationDock` to run validation checks on a timer.
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement a signal bus for broadcasting validation results.
- [ ] **Task 3**: Update UI components to subscribe to validation signals and display indicators.
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement the "click to navigate" functionality in the `ValidationDock`.
- [ ] **Task 5**: Profile the real-time validation system and optimize as needed.

## Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing**: Create missions with known errors and verify that they are correctly identified in real-time.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the editor with large, complex missions to ensure the validation system does not impact performance.
