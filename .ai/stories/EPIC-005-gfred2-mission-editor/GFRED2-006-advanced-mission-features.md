# User Story: Advanced Mission Features Integration

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-006  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Superseded (Split into GFRED2-006A, 006B, 006C, 006D)

## Story Definition
**SUPERSEDED**: This story has been split into focused, implementable stories based on BMAD team analysis.

**Original Intent**: Advanced mission editing features leveraging all integrated systems  
**Replacement Stories**:
- **GFRED2-006A**: Real-time Validation and Dependency Tracking (3 days)
- **GFRED2-006B**: Advanced SEXP Debugging Integration (3 days)
- **GFRED2-006C**: Mission Templates and Pattern Library (4 days)
- **GFRED2-006D**: Performance Profiling and Optimization Tools (3 days)

**Total Effort**: 13 days (vs. original 4-5 days estimate which was insufficient)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Real-time mission validation using integrated SEXP and asset systems
- [ ] **AC2**: Advanced SEXP debugging with breakpoints and variable watching in mission context
- [ ] **AC3**: Asset dependency tracking and validation across mission components
- [ ] **AC4**: Mission performance profiling and optimization suggestions
- [ ] **AC5**: Batch operations for multiple mission objects using integrated systems
- [ ] **AC6**: Mission templates and patterns library for common scenarios
- [ ] **AC7**: Advanced testing features including mission simulation and validation

## Technical Requirements
- **Integration**: Leverage all EPIC-001 through EPIC-004 systems
- **Advanced Features**: Build sophisticated tools on integrated foundation
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of complex missions
- **Validation**: Comprehensive checking using all available systems

## Implementation Notes
**STORY SUPERSEDED**: Analysis by BMAD team (Larry, Mo, SallySM) revealed this story was too broad for effective implementation.

**Issues Identified**:
- Scope too large (13+ days of work compressed into 4-5 day estimate)
- Multiple distinct feature areas requiring separate focus
- Complex integration requirements needing individual attention
- Testing complexity requiring focused validation per feature area

**Resolution**: Split into 4 focused stories that can be implemented and tested independently while building toward the original vision.

## Dependencies
**SUPERSEDED**: See individual replacement stories for specific dependencies.

**General Dependencies for All Replacement Stories**:
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-001, GFRED2-002, GFRED2-003, GFRED2-004 (all integrations complete)
- **Implementation Order**: 006A → 006B → 006C → 006D (recommended sequence)
- **Integration**: Each story builds on integrated foundation systems

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Real-time validation works across all mission components
- [ ] SEXP debugging provides comprehensive mission script analysis
- [ ] Asset dependency tracking prevents broken mission references
- [ ] Performance profiling identifies optimization opportunities
- [ ] Batch operations increase efficiency for repetitive tasks
- [ ] Mission templates accelerate common scenario creation
- [ ] Testing features ensure mission quality before release

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 4-5 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement real-time mission validation using all integrated systems
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create advanced SEXP debugging interface for mission context
- [ ] **Task 3**: Build asset dependency tracking and validation system
- [ ] **Task 4**: Develop mission performance profiling and optimization tools
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement batch operations for multiple object manipulation
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create mission templates and patterns library
- [ ] **Task 7**: Build comprehensive mission testing and simulation features

## Testing Strategy
- **Integration Tests**: Test advanced features with complex mission scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Validate tools work efficiently with large missions
- **User Experience Tests**: Ensure advanced features enhance rather than complicate workflow
- **Quality Tests**: Verify validation and testing features catch real issues

## Notes and Comments
**ADVANCED CAPABILITIES**: This story demonstrates the power of the integrated system by providing sophisticated mission editing capabilities that would be impossible without the foundation of EPICs 001-004.

Key advanced features:
- Real-time validation across asset, SEXP, and mission systems
- Advanced debugging with full SEXP system integration
- Performance optimization using core foundation tools
- Professional quality assurance features

This story should be implemented last as it requires all system integrations to be complete and stable.
