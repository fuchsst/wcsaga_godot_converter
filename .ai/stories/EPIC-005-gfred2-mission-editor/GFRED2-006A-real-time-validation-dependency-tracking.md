# User Story: Real-time Validation and Dependency Tracking

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-006A  
**Created**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer creating complex missions with multiple interdependent components  
**I want**: Real-time validation and dependency tracking across all mission elements  
**So that**: I can identify and resolve issues immediately while understanding component relationships

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Real-time validation of mission integrity using integrated SEXP and asset systems
- [ ] **AC2**: Asset dependency tracking identifies missing or broken references
- [ ] **AC3**: SEXP expression validation with cross-reference checking for variables and functions
- [ ] **AC4**: Mission object validation (ships, wings, waypoints) with relationship verification
- [ ] **AC5**: Visual indicators show validation status for all mission components
- [ ] **AC6**: Dependency graph visualization shows component relationships
- [ ] **AC7**: Validation results provide actionable error messages and fix suggestions
- [ ] **AC8**: Performance optimized for large missions (500+ objects, 100+ SEXP expressions)
- [ ] **AC9**: Mission statistics dashboard with complexity metrics and performance analysis
- [ ] **AC10**: Validation tools integration with mission testing and quality assurance features

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/epic-005-gfred2-mission-editor/architecture.md` Section 3 (Scene-Based UI Architecture) **ENHANCED 2025-05-30**
- **Integration**: Leverage `SexpValidator`, `AssetValidationManager`, and core foundation validation
- **Performance**: Incremental validation using dependency graphs and change tracking (< 100ms validation, < 16ms UI updates)
- **UI Integration**: Scene-based validation indicators in property editors and object hierarchy (`addons/gfred2/scenes/components/`)
- **Caching**: Efficient validation result caching with intelligent invalidation

## Implementation Notes
- **Foundation Integration**: Showcases power of integrated systems working together
- **User Experience**: Prevents mission errors before they become problems
- **Performance Critical**: Must not impact editor responsiveness
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear, non-intrusive validation status communication

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-001, GFRED2-002, GFRED2-003, GFRED2-004 (all integrations complete)
- **Blockers**: None - builds on complete integrated foundation
- **Related Stories**: Enables professional mission quality assurance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Real-time validation engine integrated with all mission components
- [ ] Asset dependency tracking prevents broken references in mission files
- [ ] SEXP validation catches syntax, semantic, and reference errors immediately
- [ ] Mission object validation ensures proper relationships and configurations
- [ ] Visual validation indicators integrated throughout editor UI
- [ ] Dependency graph available for complex mission analysis
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (validation updates within 100ms)
- [ ] Error messages provide clear guidance and suggested fixes

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create unified validation controller using integrated foundation systems
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement asset dependency tracking with missing reference detection
- [ ] **Task 3**: Integrate SEXP validation with mission-specific context checking
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add mission object validation with relationship verification
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create scene-based visual validation indicators for property editors and hierarchy (`scenes/components/validation_indicator.tscn`)
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement scene-based dependency graph visualization for complex missions (`scenes/components/dependency_graph_view.tscn`)
- [ ] **Task 7**: Optimize validation performance with caching and incremental updates
- [ ] **Task 8**: Add comprehensive error reporting with actionable fix suggestions

## Testing Strategy
- **Integration Tests**: Test validation with complex mission scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Validate real-time performance with large missions
- **User Experience Tests**: Ensure validation enhances rather than disrupts workflow
- **Quality Tests**: Verify validation catches real mission issues

## Notes and Comments
**QUALITY ASSURANCE FOCUS**: This story transforms GFRED2 into a professional mission development tool by providing comprehensive, real-time quality assurance that prevents issues before they impact gameplay.

Key capabilities:
- Immediate feedback on all mission components
- Dependency awareness preventing broken references
- Integration-powered validation using all foundation systems
- Performance optimization for professional workflows

This story demonstrates the value of the integrated foundation by providing validation capabilities that would be impossible without the complete system integration.
