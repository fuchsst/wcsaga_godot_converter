# User Story: Asset System Integration with EPIC-002

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-001  
**Created**: January 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer using GFRED2  
**I want**: The mission editor to use the standardized EPIC-002 asset system  
**So that**: All assets are consistent across the project and I can browse all available WCS assets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: GFRED2 asset browser uses `wcs_asset_core` registry instead of custom implementation
- [ ] **AC2**: All ship and weapon references use EPIC-002 `ShipData` and `WeaponData` classes
- [ ] **AC3**: Asset browsing, filtering, and search works seamlessly with core asset system
- [ ] **AC4**: Mission objects reference assets using standardized asset IDs
- [ ] **AC5**: Asset validation uses EPIC-002 validation system
- [ ] **AC6**: Asset preview and thumbnails work with core asset system
- [ ] **AC7**: Performance benchmarks met (asset loading <2s for 1000+ assets, UI responsiveness <100ms)
- [ ] **AC8**: Migration strategy preserves existing mission asset references
- [ ] **AC9**: Asset browser performance scales with large asset datasets (10,000+ assets)
- [ ] **AC10**: Tests validate integration with `wcs_asset_core` addon
- [ ] **AC11**: Advanced ship configuration support with loadout and weapon customization
- [ ] **AC12**: Asset preview integration with 3D ship models and weapon visualizations

## Technical Requirements
- **Remove**: Custom `ShipClassData`, `WeaponClassData`, and `AssetRegistry` classes
- **Replace**: Asset browser to use `RegistryManager` from `addons/wcs_asset_core/`
- **Update**: Mission object data to reference `BaseAssetData` subclasses
- **Integration**: Asset preview system with core asset loading
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading and caching for large asset collections
- **Migration**: Automated conversion of existing asset references to core system

## Implementation Notes
- **Breaking Change**: This will remove duplicate asset management code
- **Migration**: Existing missions may need asset reference updates
- **Dependencies**: Requires `wcs_asset_core` addon to be enabled
- **Testing**: Focus on asset browsing workflow and mission object creation

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-002 Asset Structures Management (completed)
- **Blockers**: None - EPIC-002 is complete and stable
- **Related Stories**: Enhances all mission editing workflows

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All duplicate asset classes removed from GFRED2 (`data/assets/` directory cleaned)
- [ ] Asset browser uses core registry with full functionality and performance optimization
- [ ] Mission objects properly reference core asset system with automated migration
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (asset loading <2s, UI interactions <100ms)
- [ ] Large dataset performance validated (10,000+ assets load and filter efficiently)
- [ ] All existing tests pass with new integration
- [ ] Comprehensive integration tests validate asset system functionality
- [ ] Migration process tested with existing GFRED2 missions
- [ ] No asset-related code duplication between GFRED2 and core

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Analyze and document existing asset references for migration planning
- [ ] **Task 2**: Remove duplicate asset classes (`ship_class_data.gd`, `weapon_class_data.gd`, `asset_data.gd`)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Update asset browser to use `RegistryManager` with performance optimization
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement automated migration for existing mission asset references
- [ ] **Task 5**: Update asset preview and thumbnail system for core integration
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add performance optimization for large asset datasets (lazy loading, caching)
- [ ] **Task 7**: Update property editors to work with core asset classes
- [ ] **Task 8**: Write comprehensive integration and performance tests
- [ ] **Task 9**: Validate migration process with existing GFRED2 missions

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test asset browser with core registry
- **Integration Tests**: Test mission object creation with core assets
- **User Experience Tests**: Validate asset browsing and selection workflow
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure asset loading performance is acceptable

## Notes and Comments
**INTEGRATION CRITICAL**: This story eliminates duplicate code and ensures consistency across the project. The asset system is foundational to all mission editing workflows.

Focus on maintaining existing functionality while switching to the core system. Asset browsing should feel seamless to users.

The core asset system is already complete and tested, so this is primarily a refactoring task with minimal risk.
