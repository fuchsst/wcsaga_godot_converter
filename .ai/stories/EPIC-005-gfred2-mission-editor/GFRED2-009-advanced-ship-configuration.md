# User Story: Advanced Ship Configuration

**Epic**: EPIC-005 - GFRED2 Mission Editor  
**Story ID**: GFRED2-009  
**Created**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: Pending

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission designer needing detailed ship customization  
**I want**: Advanced ship configuration tools that match FRED2's comprehensive ship editing capabilities  
**So that**: I can create missions with precisely configured ships, custom AI behaviors, and specialized damage systems

## WCS Source Analysis Reference
**C++ Implementation**: `shipeditordlg.cpp` (800+ lines), `shipflagsdlg.cpp`, `shipspecialdamage.cpp`, `shipspecialhitpoints.cpp`, `shiptexturesdlg.cpp`, `altshipclassdlg.cpp`  
**Key Features**: Advanced AI configuration, weapon loadouts, damage systems, hitpoint management, texture replacement, multi-ship editing  
**Complexity**: High - requires sophisticated property management, 3D previews, validation systems

- [ ] **AC2**: Comprehensive weapon loadout management with ammunition and special weapons
- [ ] **AC3**: Custom damage system configuration with subsystem-specific damage models
- [ ] **AC4**: Advanced hitpoint management with shield and hull customization
- [ ] **AC5**: Ship texture replacement and visual customization system
- [ ] **AC6**: Ship flag management for behavior modifiers and special abilities
- [ ] **AC7**: Alternative ship class assignment for dynamic mission scenarios
- [ ] **AC8**: Multi-ship batch editing for efficient wing configuration
- [ ] **AC9**: 3D ship preview with real-time configuration visualization
- [ ] **AC10**: Integration with asset system for ship class validation and compatibility

## Technical Requirements
- **Asset Integration**: Deep integration with EPIC-002 ship data and weapon systems
- **UI Framework**: Multi-tab property editor with specialized configuration panels
- **3D Preview**: Real-time ship visualization with texture and weapon preview
- **Validation**: Comprehensive configuration validation using asset system constraints
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient multi-ship editing for wing and squadron configuration

## Implementation Notes
- **Professional Feature**: Advanced ship configuration is essential for sophisticated mission design
- **Complex UI Requirements**: Multiple specialized editors requiring intuitive organization
- **Performance Critical**: Real-time 3D preview must maintain responsiveness
- **Validation Important**: Ship configurations must be validated against game constraints

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: GFRED2-001 (Asset Integration), GFRED2-004 (Core Infrastructure)
- **Blockers**: None - foundation systems provide necessary capabilities
- **Related Stories**: Builds on asset integration to provide professional ship configuration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Advanced AI behavior editor with wing formation and combat configuration
- [ ] Comprehensive weapon loadout manager with validation and preview
- [ ] Custom damage system editor with subsystem-specific configuration
- [ ] Advanced hitpoint manager with shield and hull customization
- [ ] Ship texture replacement system with real-time preview
- [ ] Ship flag management interface with comprehensive behavior modifiers
- [ ] Alternative ship class assignment system for mission flexibility
- [ ] Multi-ship batch editing with efficient wing configuration workflow
- [ ] 3D ship preview system with real-time configuration visualization
- [ ] Full integration with asset system ensuring configuration validity

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Effort**: 4 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design advanced ship configuration UI with multi-tab organization
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement AI behavior configuration with wing formation tools
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create comprehensive weapon loadout management system
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build custom damage system configuration interface
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement advanced hitpoint management with shield/hull editors
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create ship texture replacement system with preview
- [ ] **Task 7**: Build ship flag management interface with behavior modifiers
- [ ] **Task 8**: Implement alternative ship class assignment system
- [ ] **Task 9**: Add multi-ship batch editing capabilities
- [ ] **Task 10**: Create 3D ship preview with real-time configuration visualization

## Testing Strategy
- **Configuration Tests**: Test all ship configuration options with various ship classes
- **Validation Tests**: Ensure configuration validation prevents invalid setups
- **Preview Tests**: Validate 3D preview accuracy with different configurations
- **Batch Tests**: Test multi-ship editing efficiency and accuracy

## Notes and Comments
**CRITICAL FEATURE GAP**: This story addresses the missing sophisticated ship configuration capabilities identified by Larry's analysis. Advanced ship configuration is essential for creating professional-quality missions with precisely tuned ship behaviors and appearances.

Key capabilities from WCS FRED2:
- Advanced AI behavior and wing formation configuration
- Comprehensive weapon loadout management
- Custom damage and hitpoint systems
- Ship texture and visual customization
- Multi-ship batch editing capabilities

This ship configuration system enables mission creators to craft precisely tuned mission scenarios with ships configured exactly for their intended roles.
