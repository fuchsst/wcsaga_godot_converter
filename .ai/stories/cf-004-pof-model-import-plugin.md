# User Story: POF Model Import Plugin

**Epic**: Core Foundation Systems  
**Story ID**: CF-004  
**Created**: January 25, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer converting WCS assets to Godot  
**I want**: Automatic conversion of POF (3D model) files to Godot GLTF format  
**So that**: All WCS ships, weapons, and 3D models can be used in the Godot version without manual conversion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: ImportPlugin automatically detects and imports .pof files when placed in project
- [ ] **AC2**: POF models converted to GLTF with all geometry, materials, and textures preserved
- [ ] **AC3**: LOD (Level of Detail) information preserved in Godot format
- [ ] **AC4**: Model damage states and animations converted correctly
- [ ] **AC5**: Import process validates converted models against original POF data
- [ ] **AC6**: Conversion errors reported with detailed diagnostic information

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/wcs-core-foundation-prd.md` - Asset Migration Pipeline section
- **Godot Components**: ImportPlugin class, GLTF import/export, ResourceLoader
- **Performance Targets**: Import large models in <30 seconds, preserve 100% geometry accuracy
- **Integration Points**: Works with Godot's asset import system and project organization

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: POF file format specification, model loading code in `model/modelread.cpp`
- **Godot Approach**: Custom ImportPlugin with binary POF parsing and GLTF generation
- **Key Challenges**: POF format reverse engineering, material mapping, LOD preservation
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS models import successfully with visual fidelity matching originals

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (Core Manager Infrastructure Setup)
- **Blockers**: Need POF file format documentation or reverse engineering
- **Related Stories**: Model system stories require this for asset loading

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Performance targets achieved and validated
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Sample WCS models import correctly with no visual artifacts

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Research and document POF file format structure
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create ImportPlugin boilerplate and registration
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement POF binary file parsing
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build geometry conversion to Godot mesh format
- [ ] **Task 5**: Convert materials and textures to Godot materials
- [ ] **Task 6**: Preserve LOD and damage state information
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add validation and error reporting

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: POF parsing functions, geometry conversion accuracy
- **Integration Tests**: Import plugin registration, asset system integration
- **Performance Tests**: Large model import timing, memory usage
- **Manual Tests**: Visual comparison of converted models vs. originals

## Notes and Comments
HIGH RISK - POF format may have undocumented features. Start with simple models and build complexity. Consider Python prototype first if GDScript proves inadequate for binary parsing.
