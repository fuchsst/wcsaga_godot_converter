# User Story: Core Asset Loader Implementation

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-004  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer needing to load WCS assets throughout the system  
**I want**: A core asset loading system with caching, error handling, and performance optimization  
**So that**: Assets can be loaded efficiently with O(1) lookup performance and intelligent memory management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: `AssetLoader` singleton class implemented with static access methods for global availability
- [ ] **AC2**: Asset loading functions support synchronous and asynchronous loading patterns
- [ ] **AC3**: Built-in caching system with LRU eviction and configurable memory limits (target: <100MB)
- [ ] **AC4**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation for missing/invalid assets
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance targets met: <1ms asset lookup for cached assets, <100ms for uncached loads
- [ ] **AC6**: Asset dependency tracking and automatic unloading for memory management

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Asset Loading Architecture](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#asset-loading-architecture)
- **Godot Components**: ResourceLoader, autoload singleton, async loading, memory management
- **Integration Points**: Used by all game systems requiring asset access, FRED2 editor integration

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: WCS bmpman.cpp caching system (4,750 texture slots) and model loading infrastructure
- **Godot Approach**: Leverage Godot's ResourceLoader with custom caching layer for performance
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing memory usage with performance, handling large asset collections efficiently
- **Success Metrics**: O(1) lookup performance, memory usage within limits, zero loading hitches during gameplay

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001 (Plugin Framework), ASM-002 (Base Asset Data), ASM-003 (Asset Types) completed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: ASM-008 (Registry Manager), ASM-009 (Validation System) will use this loader

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validated with representative asset loads
- [ ] Memory usage profiling shows efficient cache management
- [ ] Error handling tested with various failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation includes performance tuning guidelines
- [ ] Unit tests cover all loading scenarios and edge cases

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `AssetLoader` singleton class in `loaders/asset_loader.gd`
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement synchronous asset loading with error handling
- [ ] **Task 3**: Add asynchronous loading support for large assets
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build LRU cache system with configurable memory limits
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement asset dependency tracking and automatic cleanup
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add performance monitoring and profiling hooks
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create comprehensive test suite and benchmarking tools

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Loading functions, cache operations, error handling, memory management
- **Performance Tests**: Loading speed benchmarks, memory usage profiling, cache efficiency
- **Integration Tests**: Usage by other components, large asset collection handling
- **Manual Tests**: Load representative WCS asset collections, verify performance targets

## Notes and Comments
**PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: This component is central to all asset operations and must meet strict performance requirements. The WCS conversion depends on efficient asset access.

**CACHING STRATEGY**: Godot's built-in ResourceLoader provides some caching, but we need additional optimization for WCS's large asset collections and specific usage patterns.

**MEMORY MANAGEMENT**: Must balance keeping frequently-used assets in memory with preventing memory bloat for large mod collections.
