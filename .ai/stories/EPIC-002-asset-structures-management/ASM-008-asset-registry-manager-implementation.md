# User Story: Asset Registry Manager Implementation

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-008  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer working with large collections of WCS assets  
**I want**: A comprehensive asset registry system with discovery, cataloging, and search capabilities  
**So that**: Assets can be efficiently discovered, organized, and accessed throughout the project without manual path management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: `RegistryManager` singleton class provides asset discovery and cataloging functionality
- [ ] **AC2**: Automatic asset scanning of configured directories with recursive subdirectory support
- [ ] **AC3**: Asset registration system supporting all asset types with metadata indexing
- [ ] **AC4**: Search functionality by name, type, tags, and custom properties with fuzzy matching
- [ ] **AC5**: Asset dependency tracking and relationship visualization for complex asset networks
- [ ] **AC6**: Registry persistence and caching for fast startup times and incremental updates

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Registry Manager for Asset Discovery](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#asset-loading-architecture)
- **Godot Components**: FileAccess, Directory scanning, serialization, singleton pattern
- **Integration Points**: AssetLoader for loading, ValidationManager for integrity, Editor UI for browsing

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Asset organization patterns from WCS directory structure and mod management
- **Godot Approach**: Leverage Godot's file system APIs with custom indexing for performance
- **Key Challenges**: Handling large asset collections efficiently, maintaining registry consistency
- **Success Metrics**: Fast asset discovery (<100ms), comprehensive search results, reliable dependency tracking

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001-007 (Framework through Armor Data) completed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: ASM-009 (Validation), ASM-010 (Search), ASM-011 (Integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Asset scanning performance optimized for large collections
- [ ] Registry data persistence and loading functional
- [ ] Search functionality comprehensive and fast
- [ ] Documentation includes registry management and maintenance
- [ ] Unit tests cover all registry operations and edge cases

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `RegistryManager` singleton class in `loaders/registry_manager.gd`
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement recursive asset directory scanning with progress tracking
- [ ] **Task 3**: Build asset registration system with metadata extraction
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create search index with name, type, and property indexing
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement asset dependency tracking and relationship mapping
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add registry persistence with incremental update support
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create performance benchmarks and optimization for large asset sets

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Registry operations, search functions, dependency tracking
- **Performance Tests**: Large asset collection scanning, search speed benchmarks
- **Integration Tests**: AssetLoader integration, registry consistency validation
- **Manual Tests**: Scan real WCS asset directories, verify discovery and search

## Notes and Comments
**PERFORMANCE FOCUS**: Asset registries can become bottlenecks with large mod collections. Efficient indexing and caching are essential for good developer experience.

**DEPENDENCY TRACKING**: Complex assets (ships with weapons, missions with ships) create dependency networks that must be tracked for proper asset management.

**INCREMENTAL UPDATES**: Registry should only rescan changed assets, not rebuild entirely, for fast iteration during development.
