# User Story: Asset Validation System

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-009  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Content creator working with WCS assets  
**I want**: A comprehensive asset validation system with error detection, warnings, and fixing suggestions  
**So that**: Asset integrity can be verified automatically and problems can be identified before they cause runtime issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: `ValidationManager` singleton class provides comprehensive asset validation functionality
- [ ] **AC2**: Validation rules for all asset types (ships, weapons, armor) with type-specific checks
- [ ] **AC3**: Error classification system: critical errors, warnings, suggestions with detailed descriptions
- [ ] **AC4**: Asset dependency validation ensuring all referenced resources exist and are valid
- [ ] **AC5**: Batch validation capabilities for validating entire asset collections efficiently
- [ ] **AC6**: Validation reporting with actionable error messages and fixing suggestions

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Validation System Architecture](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#validation-system-architecture)
- **Godot Components**: Validation rules, error reporting, resource dependency checking
- **Integration Points**: AssetLoader for asset access, RegistryManager for batch operations, Editor UI for reporting

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Asset integrity patterns and validation needs from WCS content pipeline
- **Godot Approach**: Extensible validation rule system with clear error reporting and categorization
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing comprehensive checking with performance for large asset collections
- **Success Metrics**: Accurate error detection, clear error messages, fast validation performance

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001-008 (Framework through Registry Manager) completed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: ASM-010 (Search), ASM-011 (Integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Validation rules comprehensive for all asset types
- [ ] Error reporting clear and actionable
- [ ] Batch validation performance optimized
- [ ] Documentation includes validation rule reference
- [ ] Unit tests cover all validation scenarios and edge cases

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `ValidationManager` singleton class in `loaders/validation_manager.gd`
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement validation rule registration and execution system
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create asset-specific validation rules for ships, weapons, armor
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build dependency validation for asset references and paths
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement batch validation with progress reporting
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create validation result reporting with error categorization
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add comprehensive validation tests and error scenario coverage

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Validation rules, error detection, dependency checking
- **Integration Tests**: Asset validation, batch operations, reporting system
- **Manual Tests**: Validate various asset types, verify error messages and suggestions
- **Error Tests**: Create deliberately broken assets and verify proper error detection

## Notes and Comments
**VALIDATION DEPTH**: Asset validation should catch both obvious errors (missing required fields) and subtle issues (invalid references, performance problems).

**ERROR QUALITY**: Error messages must be clear and actionable for content creators, not just technical diagnostic information.

**PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATION**: Validation should be fast enough to run automatically without disrupting content creation workflow.
