# User Story: Game Integration and Migration

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-011  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer integrating the asset management addon with the main game and FRED2 editor  
**I want**: Seamless integration that replaces existing asset systems without breaking functionality  
**So that**: Both the main game and editor use the shared addon for consistent asset management with zero code duplication

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Main game refactored to use addon for all asset operations, removing duplicate asset code
- [ ] **AC2**: FRED2 editor integration using shared asset structures and browsing capabilities
- [ ] **AC3**: Backward compatibility maintained for existing asset references and save files
- [ ] **AC4**: Migration utilities provided for converting existing asset references to addon paths
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance verification that addon integration meets or exceeds previous asset loading times
- [ ] **AC6**: Documentation updated with new asset management workflows and API references

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Main Game Integration](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#main-game-integration) and [FRED2 Editor Integration](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#fred2-editor-integration)
- **Godot Components**: Addon activation, autoload integration, legacy code removal, migration scripts
- **Integration Points**: All game systems using assets, FRED2 asset browser, existing asset loading code

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Current asset loading patterns in main game and editor that need to be replaced
- **Godot Approach**: Gradual migration with compatibility layer to prevent breaking changes
- **Key Challenges**: Ensuring no functionality regression during migration, maintaining save file compatibility
- **Success Metrics**: Zero functionality loss, improved performance, eliminated code duplication

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001-010 (All previous stories) completed and tested
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: This story completes the EPIC-002 implementation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Main game fully migrated to addon with all asset operations functional
- [ ] FRED2 editor integration complete and tested
- [ ] Migration utilities functional and documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no regression
- [ ] Integration testing passes for all affected systems
- [ ] Documentation complete with migration guide and new API reference

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Audit existing asset loading code in main game and identify integration points
- [ ] **Task 2**: Refactor main game asset systems to use addon API
- [ ] **Task 3**: Integrate addon with FRED2 editor for shared asset management
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create migration utilities for existing asset references
- [ ] **Task 5**: Remove duplicate asset code and verify no functionality loss
- [ ] **Task 6**: Performance testing and optimization to meet/exceed previous benchmarks
- [ ] **Task 7**: Update documentation with new workflows and complete API reference

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Integration points, migration utilities, API compatibility
- **Integration Tests**: Complete game functionality, FRED2 editor operations
- **Performance Tests**: Asset loading benchmarks, memory usage comparison
- **Regression Tests**: Verify all existing functionality works with addon
- **Manual Tests**: Complete game and editor workflow validation

## Notes and Comments
**MIGRATION COMPLEXITY**: This story involves touching many existing systems, requiring careful coordination to prevent breaking changes.

**PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Asset loading performance is critical for game experience - must maintain or improve current performance levels.

**DOCUMENTATION ESSENTIAL**: New workflows and API changes require comprehensive documentation for all developers.

**VALIDATION THOROUGHNESS**: Complete integration testing is essential to ensure no functionality is lost during migration.
