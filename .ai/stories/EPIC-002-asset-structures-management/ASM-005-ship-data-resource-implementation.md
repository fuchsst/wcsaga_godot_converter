# User Story: Ship Data Resource Implementation

**Epic**: EPIC-002 - Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Story ID**: ASM-005  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Content creator defining ship specifications for WCS conversion  
**I want**: A comprehensive ShipData Resource class with all WCS ship properties and subsystem definitions  
**So that**: Ship classes can be edited in Godot inspector and maintain complete compatibility with original WCS ship specifications

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: `ShipData` Resource class extends BaseAssetData with all 237 fields from original ship_info structure
- [ ] **AC2**: Export properties organized in logical groups (Movement, Combat, Appearance, Subsystems) with tooltips
- [ ] **AC3**: Subsystem architecture implemented with ComponentDefinition sub-resources for engines, weapons, sensors
- [ ] **AC4**: Weapon mounting system using resource paths to resolve circular dependencies (ship ↔ weapon)
- [ ] **AC5**: Ship validation includes range checks, required field validation, and subsystem integrity
- [ ] **AC6**: Inspector integration provides intuitive editing with proper property organization and helpful tooltips

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: [Ship Asset Extension](../../docs/EPIC-002-asset-structures-management-addon/architecture.md#asset-data-structure-hierarchy)
- **Godot Components**: Resource class, export properties, sub-resources, property groups
- **Integration Points**: ComponentFactory for ship instantiation, WeaponData for armament, AssetLoader for loading

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `ship/ship.h` ship_info structure (~237 fields), weapon mounting system, subsystem definitions
- **Godot Approach**: Use Godot Resource system with sub-resources for component architecture
- **Key Challenges**: Breaking circular dependency between ships and weapons using resource paths
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS ship properties preserved, clean inspector editing, validation catches errors

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: ASM-001-004 (Framework, Base, Types, Loader) completed
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: ASM-006 (WeaponData), ASM-007 (ArmorData), ASM-011 (Integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] All WCS ship properties mapped and validated
- [ ] Inspector integration works smoothly with organized property groups
- [ ] Circular dependency resolution functional and tested
- [ ] Documentation includes property mapping from WCS to Godot
- [ ] Unit tests cover validation and property access

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `ShipData` Resource class in `structures/ship_data.gd`
- [ ] **Task 2**: Map all 237 ship_info fields to typed export properties
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement property groups for logical organization in inspector
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create `ComponentDefinition` sub-resource for subsystems
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement weapon mounting system with resource path references
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add ship-specific validation rules and error checking
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create comprehensive test ship assets and validation tests

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Property validation, subsystem creation, weapon mounting
- **Integration Tests**: Asset loading, inspector editing, validation system
- **Manual Tests**: Create test ships in inspector, verify all properties work correctly
- **Validation Tests**: Load original WCS ship data and verify compatibility

## Notes and Comments
**COMPLEXITY WARNING**: Ships are the most complex asset type in WCS with 237+ fields and intricate subsystem relationships. This story requires careful analysis of the original ship_info structure.

**CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY SOLUTION**: The architecture uses resource paths instead of direct object references to break the ship ↔ weapon circular dependency. This must be implemented carefully to maintain performance.

**SUBSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**: Ships have complex subsystem definitions (engines, weapons, sensors, turrets) that need to be preserved while adapting to Godot's component system.
