# User Story: Mission Object Management System

**Story ID**: STORY-008  
**Epic**: EPIC-002 (FRED2 Mission Editor)  
**Phase**: 1 (Foundation)  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 10  
**Assignee**: Dev (GDScript Developer)  
**Status**: Completed ✅  
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-25

## User Story

**As a** mission creator  
**I want** to create, configure, and manage mission objects (ships, waypoints, etc.)  
**So that** I can build complete missions with properly configured objects and their properties

## Background Context

The Mission Object Management System provides the core editing functionality for creating and configuring mission elements. This system must bridge the gap between mission data resources and 3D viewport visualization while providing intuitive object creation and configuration workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Object Creation System
```gherkin
Given I am editing a mission
When I want to create new objects
Then I should be able to:
  - Create ships by selecting ship class from a list
  - Create waypoints with different types (navigation, patrol, etc.)
  - Create wing formations with multiple ships
  - Place objects at cursor position in 3D viewport
And newly created objects should appear immediately in viewport
And objects should be assigned unique names automatically
And objects should have reasonable default properties set
```

### AC-2: Object Configuration Interface
```gherkin
Given I have selected a mission object
When I configure its properties
Then I should be able to edit:
  - Object name and basic identification
  - Position and orientation values
  - Ship class and team assignment
  - AI behavior and difficulty settings
  - Cargo and special properties
  - Arrival and departure conditions
And changes should update in real-time in the viewport
And all changes should be validated for correctness
And the interface should prevent invalid configurations
```

### AC-3: Object Hierarchy and Organization
```gherkin
Given I have multiple objects in my mission
When I organize them
Then I should be able to:
  - Group objects into logical hierarchies
  - Create wing formations with member ships
  - Assign ships to teams and factions
  - Filter and search objects by properties
And the organization should be reflected in both data and UI
And hierarchical relationships should be preserved in exports
And bulk operations should work on groups of objects
```

### AC-4: Object Lifecycle Management
```gherkin
Given I am working with mission objects
When I manage their lifecycle
Then I should be able to:
  - Duplicate objects with all properties
  - Delete objects with confirmation for important items
  - Cut/copy/paste objects between missions
  - Undo/redo all object operations
And deleted objects should be removed from all references
And operations should maintain data integrity
And clipboard operations should work across editor sessions
```

### AC-5: Property Validation and Feedback
```gherkin
Given I am configuring object properties
When I enter invalid or problematic values
Then the system should:
  - Highlight invalid fields with clear error messages
  - Prevent saving of invalid configurations
  - Suggest valid alternatives where possible
  - Warn about potential gameplay issues
And validation should happen in real-time as I type
And warnings should be distinguishable from hard errors
```

### AC-6: Integration with 3D Viewport
```gherkin
Given I have objects in the 3D viewport
When I interact with them
Then the object management system should:
  - Sync selection between viewport and object list
  - Update 3D representation when properties change
  - Handle drag-and-drop creation from asset browser
  - Support context menus for common operations
And viewport operations should trigger appropriate property updates
And 3D transformations should update position/rotation properties
```
