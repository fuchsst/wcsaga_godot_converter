# User Story: Game State Management System

**Epic**: Core Foundation Systems  
**Story ID**: CF-003  
**Created**: January 25, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Player navigating through WCS menus and gameplay  
**I want**: Seamless transitions between main menu, briefings, missions, and debriefs  
**So that**: The game flow feels polished and responsive without loading delays or state loss

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: All WCS game states implemented (MAIN_MENU, BRIEFING, MISSION, DEBRIEF, OPTIONS, CAMPAIGN_MENU, LOADING)
- [ ] **AC2**: State transitions complete in <1 second with loading indicators
- [ ] **AC3**: No data loss during state transitions (player progress, mission status, etc.)
- [ ] **AC4**: Scene loading/unloading works correctly for each state
- [ ] **AC5**: Recovery system handles failed state transitions gracefully
- [ ] **AC6**: State stack supports returning to previous states (e.g., pause menu)

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/wcs-core-foundation-architecture.md` - GameStateManager section
- **Godot Components**: GameStateManager singleton, state machine pattern, scene management
- **Performance Targets**: <1 second state transitions, no memory leaks between states
- **Integration Points**: All UI systems and gameplay systems respect current game state

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `freespace.cpp` game sequence management, state machine
- **Godot Approach**: Enum-based state machine with SceneTree scene management
- **Key Challenges**: Preserving state data during transitions, proper resource cleanup
- **Success Metrics**: All state transitions work smoothly, no crashes or data loss

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (Core Manager Infrastructure Setup)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: All UI and gameplay stories depend on proper state management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Performance targets achieved and validated
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] All state transitions tested and working reliably

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement GameState enum and state machine logic
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create state transition system with loading indicators
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement scene management for each game state
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build state stack for pause/resume functionality
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add persistent data preservation during transitions
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create error recovery for failed state transitions
- [ ] **Task 7**: Integration testing with basic scene loading

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: State transition logic, state stack operations, data preservation
- **Integration Tests**: Scene loading/unloading, integration with other managers
- **Performance Tests**: Transition timing, memory usage during state changes
- **Manual Tests**: Complete game flow testing, error scenario testing

## Notes and Comments
Foundation for all user interaction. Must be bulletproof since players will experience this constantly. Focus on smooth transitions and data integrity.
