## User Story

**As a** player  
**I want** campaign progression that tracks my mission completion and unlocks appropriate content  
**So that** I can experience the story progression and access new missions based on my performance and choices  

## Story Description

Implement a comprehensive campaign progression system that manages mission completion tracking, unlocks missions based on prerequisite completion and story choices, and maintains campaign state across game sessions. This system replicates the WCS campaign branching logic with mission dependencies and conditional unlocking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Campaign State Management**: Complete campaign progression tracking
  - [ ] Campaign loading and initialization from campaign files
  - [ ] Mission completion status tracking with detailed results
  - [ ] Campaign progress percentage calculation and display
  - [ ] Support for multiple concurrent campaigns per pilot

- [ ] **Mission Unlocking Logic**: Sophisticated mission availability system
  - [ ] Prerequisite-based mission unlocking (linear and branching)
  - [ ] Performance-based unlocking (mission score thresholds)
  - [ ] Choice-based branching (story decision consequences)
  - [ ] Dynamic mission availability recalculation

- [ ] **Story Branching System**: Complex narrative branching support
  - [ ] Story choice recording and persistence
  - [ ] Branch evaluation using SEXP-like conditions
  - [ ] Multiple story path support with branch convergence
  - [ ] Branch state validation and consistency checking

- [ ] **Campaign Integration**: Seamless integration with game systems
  - [ ] Mission briefing data provision for unlocked missions
  - [ ] Campaign-specific variables and flags management
  - [ ] Save system integration for campaign persistence
  - [ ] UI integration for campaign selection and progress display

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Reference
- **Architecture Document**: `EPIC-007-overall-game-flow-state-management/architecture.md` (lines 237-300)
