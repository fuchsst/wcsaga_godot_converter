# User Story: Audio Configuration and Control Mapping

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-011  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: Complete audio settings and control mapping options that allow me to customize my gameplay experience  
**So that**: I can adjust sound levels, configure input controls, and set up my preferred control scheme

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Audio options scene with volume controls for music, sound effects, voice, and ambient audio
- [ ] **AC2**: Control mapping interface allowing full keyboard and joystick customization
- [ ] **AC3**: Real-time audio testing with sample playback for volume level validation
- [ ] **AC4**: Input conflict detection and resolution for control mapping
- [ ] **AC5**: Support for multiple input devices with device-specific configurations
- [ ] **AC6**: Accessibility options including subtitle settings and audio cue enhancements

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - Audio and control configuration section
- **Godot Components**: Audio bus management, input mapping, device detection, accessibility features
- **Integration Points**: Godot audio system, input system, ConfigurationManager persistence

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/menuui/optionsmenu.cpp` - audio and control configuration
- **Godot Approach**: Scene-based configuration with Godot input system integration
- **Key Challenges**: Input conflict resolution, device detection, real-time audio feedback
- **Success Metrics**: All controls mappable, audio settings properly applied, conflict-free configuration

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - ConfigurationManager (EPIC-001 completed)
  - MENU-003 (shared UI components)
  - MENU-010 (options framework)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-012 (settings persistence), input system integration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: Medium

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create audio_options.tscn scene with volume sliders and audio controls
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create controls_options.tscn scene with input mapping interface
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement ControlMapper class for input configuration and conflict detection
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add real-time audio testing with sample playback system
- [ ] **Task 5**: Build input device detection and multi-device support
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement accessibility options for subtitles and audio cues
- [ ] **Task 7**: Create control preset system for common control schemes

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test input mapping, conflict detection, audio bus management
- **Integration Tests**: Verify device detection and configuration persistence
- **Manual Tests**: Control mapping workflow, audio testing, accessibility features

## Notes and Comments
This story has complexity due to input device variety and conflict resolution requirements. Accessibility features are important for inclusive design.
