# User Story: Pilot Creation and Management System

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-004  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: A comprehensive pilot creation and management system that handles pilot profiles, statistics, and progression  
**So that**: I can create, customize, and manage pilot profiles with full campaign progression tracking like the original WCS

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Pilot creation scene allows name, callsign, squadron, and image selection with validation
- [ ] **AC2**: Pilot selection scene displays all available pilots with preview and selection functionality
- [ ] **AC3**: Pilot statistics scene shows detailed progression, medals, and campaign status
- [ ] **AC4**: Pilot data persistence using SaveGameManager integration with corruption protection
- [ ] **AC5**: Support for multiple pilots with proper file management and backup systems
- [ ] **AC6**: Migration support for existing WCS pilot files (if available)

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - PilotDataManager and PilotProfileData sections
- **Godot Components**: Resource-based pilot data, SaveGameManager integration, scene management
- **Integration Points**: SaveGameManager autoload, ConfigurationManager, validation systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/menuui/playermenu.cpp`, `barracks.cpp` - pilot management functionality
- **Godot Approach**: Resource-based PilotProfileData with SaveGameManager persistence
- **Key Challenges**: WCS pilot file compatibility, validation, corruption recovery
- **Success Metrics**: All WCS pilot features implemented, robust save/load, no data loss

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - MENU-001 (main menu framework)
  - MENU-003 (shared UI components)
  - SaveGameManager (EPIC-001 completed)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-005 (campaign system), MENU-006 (statistics)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement PilotProfileData Resource class with full WCS pilot properties
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create pilot_creation.tscn scene with form validation and image selection
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement pilot_selection.tscn scene with pilot browser and preview
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build pilot_stats.tscn scene showing progression and medal display
- [ ] **Task 5**: Integrate PilotDataManager with SaveGameManager for persistence
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add pilot file validation, corruption detection, and backup systems
- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement WCS pilot file migration system (if format available)

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test pilot data validation, save/load operations, corruption handling
- **Integration Tests**: Verify SaveGameManager integration and file system operations
- **Manual Tests**: Pilot creation workflow, data persistence, migration testing

## Notes and Comments
This is a complex story due to the critical nature of pilot data and the need for backwards compatibility. Corruption protection and backup systems are essential.
