# User Story: Main Menu Scene and Navigation Framework

**Epic**: EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system  
**Story ID**: MENU-001  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS player  
**I want**: A functional main menu that provides access to all primary game functions  
**So that**: I can navigate to pilot management, campaign selection, options, and other core game features with the familiar WCS experience

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Main menu scene loads successfully with all navigation options visible and properly styled
- [ ] **AC2**: Navigation to pilot selection, campaign menu, options, and credits works correctly using existing GameStateManager
- [ ] **AC3**: All menu transitions use SceneManager addon with appropriate WCS-style transition effects (fade, dissolve)
- [ ] **AC4**: Menu background displays properly with support for animated WCS-style backgrounds
- [ ] **AC5**: Menu responds to both keyboard and mouse input with proper focus management
- [ ] **AC6**: Main menu maintains 60fps performance with smooth transitions under 100ms

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/EPIC-006-menu-navigation-system/architecture.md` - Main Menu Scene and Navigation Framework section
- **Godot Components**: Control nodes, scene composition, GameStateManager integration, SceneManager addon
- **Integration Points**: GameStateManager autoload, SceneManager addon, WCS Asset Core for menu assets

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/menuui/mainhallmenu.cpp`, `mainhallmenu.h` - Main hall navigation system
- **Godot Approach**: Scene-based menu architecture using Control nodes with signal-driven navigation
- **Key Challenges**: Integrating with existing GameStateManager state machine, ensuring performance targets
- **Success Metrics**: 60fps performance, transition times <100ms, proper state management

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - EPIC-001 GameStateManager (completed)
  - EPIC-001 ConfigurationManager (completed)
  - SceneManager addon (available)
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Related Stories**: MENU-002 (transition system), MENU-003 (shared components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Feature validated against original C++ code behavior

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
Break down the story into specific implementation tasks:
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create main_menu.tscn scene with Control node hierarchy and layout
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement main_menu_controller.gd with navigation logic using GameStateManager
- [ ] **Task 3**: Integrate SceneManager addon for scene transitions
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add input handling for keyboard navigation (arrows, enter, escape)
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement menu background system with support for static and animated backgrounds
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create navigation signals and connect to GameStateManager state transitions
- [ ] **Task 7**: Add performance monitoring to ensure 60fps and <100ms transitions

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test navigation logic, input handling, and state transitions
- **Integration Tests**: Verify GameStateManager integration and SceneManager transitions
- **Manual Tests**: Navigation flow testing, performance validation, visual appearance

## Notes and Comments
This story establishes the foundation for all menu navigation. It must properly integrate with existing autoload systems rather than creating new ones, following the approved architecture.
