## Performance Targets
- AI update frequency: Variable (60Hz near player, 10Hz distant)
- Decision-making latency: <10ms per ship per frame
- Memory usage: <100MB for 50+ AI ships
- Navigation calculation: <5ms per ship per frame
- Frame rate: >60fps with realistic AI ship counts

## AI Behavior Patterns to Implement
- **Fighter AI**: Aggressive, fast attack patterns, evasive maneuvers
- **Bomber AI**: Methodical, target priority on capital ships, defensive
- **Capital Ship AI**: Strategic positioning, long-range engagement
- **Escort AI**: Protective behavior, formation flying, threat response
- **Patrol AI**: Route following, investigation of anomalies

## LimboAI Integration Consideration
```gdscript
# Potential LimboAI behavior tree integration
extends BTComposite

func _tick(delta: float) -> int:
    # Behavior tree nodes for AI decision making
    # - BTSelector for choosing between combat/patrol/escort
    # - BTSequence for complex maneuvers
    # - BTCondition for state checks
    # - BTAction for movement/firing commands
```

## Integration Points
- **Ship Systems**: AI controls ship movement and weapons
- **Weapon Systems**: AI uses weapon targeting and firing
- **ObjectManager**: AI updates scheduled efficiently
- **PhysicsManager**: AI uses physics for movement predictions
- **Communication**: AI status updates and coordination

## AI State Machine Example
```gdscript
enum AIState {
    IDLE,        # No current objective
    PATROL,      # Following waypoint route
    INVESTIGATE, # Checking out something interesting
    ENGAGE,      # Active combat with target
    ESCORT,      # Protecting friendly ship
    FLEE,        # Retreating from overwhelming force
    DOCK         # Returning to base/carrier
}
```
