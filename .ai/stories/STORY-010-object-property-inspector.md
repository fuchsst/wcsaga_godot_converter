## User Story

**As a** mission creator  
**I want** a comprehensive property inspector for mission objects  
**So that** I can efficiently view and edit all properties of ships, waypoints, and mission elements with real-time validation and contextual help

## Background Context

The current object property editor from STORY-008 provides basic property editing, but mission creators need a more sophisticated inspector similar to Godot's Inspector dock. This should provide categorized properties, visual editors for specific types (colors, vectors, enums), real-time validation, undo/redo integration, and contextual help for WCS-specific properties.

This builds on the foundation of the Mission Object Management System and integrates with the Visual SEXP Editor for complex property expressions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-010-1: Enhanced Property Organization
```gherkin
Given I have selected a mission object
When I view the property inspector
Then I should see properties organized in logical categories:
  - Transform (position, rotation, scale)
  - Visual (model, textures, colors)
  - Behavior (AI, orders, flags)
  - Mission Logic (goals, events, SEXP expressions)
  - Advanced (physics, collision, special properties)
And each category should be collapsible/expandable
And categories should remember their collapsed state
```

### AC-010-2: Type-Specific Property Editors
```gherkin
Given I'm editing different property types
When I interact with each property
Then I should have appropriate editors:
  - Vector3: X/Y/Z spinboxes with reset and copy/paste
  - Color: Color picker with alpha support
  - Enum: Dropdown with human-readable labels
  - Boolean: Checkbox with clear labeling
  - String: Text field with validation
  - Number: Spinbox with appropriate min/max/step
  - SEXP: Button to open visual SEXP editor
  - File Path: File browser with type filtering
And each editor should provide immediate visual feedback
```

### AC-010-3: Real-time Validation and Feedback
```gherkin
Given I'm editing object properties
When I change any property value
Then validation should occur immediately
And invalid values should be highlighted in red
And warning values should be highlighted in yellow
And valid values should appear in normal styling
And tooltip errors should explain validation issues
And the 3D viewport should update to reflect changes
And changes should be applied to the mission data instantly
```

### AC-010-4: Advanced Editing Features
```gherkin
Given I'm working with complex properties
When I need advanced editing capabilities
Then I should have access to:
  - Multi-select editing (change properties for multiple objects)
  - Copy/paste property values between objects
  - Property reset to default values
  - Property templates and presets
  - Search/filter properties by name
  - Property comparison (show differences between objects)
  - Batch operations for similar objects
And operations should integrate with undo/redo system
```

### AC-010-5: Contextual Help and Documentation
```gherkin
Given I'm editing unfamiliar WCS properties
When I need help understanding a property
Then I should have access to:
  - Tooltip descriptions for every property
  - "?" help buttons linking to detailed documentation
  - Property value examples and valid ranges
  - Related property suggestions
  - Common configuration presets
  - Integration hints for SEXP expressions
And help content should be accurate and up-to-date
```

### AC-010-6: Performance and Responsiveness
```gherkin
Given I'm working with complex missions
When I select objects with many properties
Then the property inspector should:
  - Load and display properties within 100ms
  - Handle 500+ properties without performance degradation
  - Update smoothly during real-time editing
  - Maintain 60 FPS during property changes
  - Use lazy loading for expensive property calculations
  - Cache property metadata for repeated access
And memory usage should remain under 20MB for large missions
```

### Integration Points

**With Visual SEXP Editor**:
```gdscript
# Open SEXP editor for property
func _on_sexp_property_edit_requested(property_name: String) -> void:
    var sexp_editor: VisualSexpEditor = get_sexp_editor()
    sexp_editor.load_expression_from_property(current_object, property_name)
    sexp_editor.expression_changed.connect(_on_sexp_expression_changed)
    show_sexp_editor()

func _on_sexp_expression_changed(new_expression: String) -> void:
    update_property_value(current_property, new_expression)
```

**With Mission Object Manager**:
```gdscript
# Multi-object selection handling
func _on_selection_changed(selected_objects: Array[MissionObjectData]) -> void:
    if selected_objects.size() == 1:
        show_single_object_properties(selected_objects[0])
    elif selected_objects.size() > 1:
        show_multi_object_properties(selected_objects)
    else:
        clear_properties()
```

**With Undo/Redo System**:
```gdscript
# Property change with undo support
func set_property_value(property_name: String, new_value: Variant) -> void:
    var old_value: Variant = current_object.get(property_name)
    
    undo_redo.create_action("Change " + property_name)
    undo_redo.add_do_method(current_object, "set", property_name, new_value)
    undo_redo.add_undo_method(current_object, "set", property_name, old_value)
    undo_redo.add_do_method(self, "_refresh_property", property_name)
    undo_redo.add_undo_method(self, "_refresh_property", property_name)
    undo_redo.commit_action()
```
