# User Story: Basic 3D Viewport Integration

**Story ID**: STORY-007  
**Epic**: EPIC-002 (FRED2 Mission Editor)  
**Phase**: 1 (Foundation)  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 10  
**Assignee**: Dev (GDScript Developer)  
**Status**: Completed ✅  
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-25

## User Story

**As a** mission creator  
**I want** a 3D viewport that displays mission objects and allows basic manipulation  
**So that** I can visually place and arrange ships, waypoints, and other mission elements in 3D space

## Background Context

The 3D viewport is the primary interface for mission editing, replacing FRED2's Windows-based 3D view with Godot's modern 3D editor capabilities. This system must provide intuitive object manipulation using familiar gizmos while maintaining high performance for missions with many objects.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: 3D Viewport Setup and Integration
```gherkin
Given I open the mission editor
When the 3D viewport is initialized
Then it should display a 3D scene with:
  - Proper camera controls (pan, zoom, rotate)
  - Grid overlay for spatial reference
  - Background starfield or appropriate environment
  - Coordinate system indicators
And it should integrate seamlessly with Godot's editor interface
And it should support both perspective and orthographic views
```

### AC-2: Mission Object Visualization
```gherkin
Given I have imported a mission with objects
When the mission loads in the 3D viewport
Then it should display all mission objects as 3D representations:
  - Ships shown with placeholder or simple models
  - Waypoints displayed as distinctive 3D markers
  - Wing formations shown with formation indicators
  - Object names displayed as labels when selected
And objects should be positioned correctly according to mission data
And different object types should be visually distinguishable
```

### AC-3: Object Selection System
```gherkin
Given I have objects displayed in the 3D viewport
When I interact with objects
Then I should be able to:
  - Click to select individual objects
  - Multi-select objects using Ctrl+click
  - Box-select multiple objects by dragging
  - Select all objects with Ctrl+A
And selected objects should be visually highlighted
And selection should trigger property panel updates
And selection state should be maintained across operations
```

### AC-4: Basic Object Manipulation
```gherkin
Given I have selected one or more objects
When I use manipulation tools
Then I should be able to:
  - Translate objects using move gizmo
  - Rotate objects using rotation gizmo
  - Snap objects to grid when enabled
  - Undo/redo transformation operations
And transformations should update mission data immediately
And all changes should be reflected in the property panel
And gizmos should follow Godot's standard behavior
```

### AC-5: Camera Controls and Navigation
```gherkin
Given I am working in the 3D viewport
When I use navigation controls
Then I should be able to:
  - Pan the view by middle-mouse dragging
  - Zoom in/out using mouse wheel
  - Orbit around objects by holding right-click and dragging
  - Focus on selected objects with 'F' key
  - Reset view to origin with shortcut
And camera movement should be smooth and responsive
And camera state should be preserved between sessions
```

### AC-6: Performance and Responsiveness
```gherkin
Given I have a mission with up to 100 objects loaded
When I interact with the 3D viewport
Then it should maintain 60 FPS during normal operations
And object selection should respond within 50ms
And transformation operations should be smooth and real-time
And viewport updates should not block the UI
And memory usage should remain reasonable (<100MB for typical missions)
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Core Classes Required
```gdscript
# Main 3D viewport for mission editing
class_name MissionViewport3D extends SubViewport

# 3D representation of mission objects
class_name MissionObjectNode3D extends Node3D

# Camera controller for viewport navigation
class_name MissionCamera3D extends Camera3D

# Object selection and manipulation manager
class_name ObjectSelector extends Node

# Gizmo integration for object manipulation
class_name MissionGizmoPlugin extends EditorPlugin
```

### File Structure
```

├── mission_viewport_3d.gd      # Main viewport controller
├── mission_camera_3d.gd        # Camera controls and navigation
├── object_selector.gd          # Selection management

└── ui/
    ├── viewport_overlay.gd     # UI overlays on viewport
    └── object_labels.gd        # Object name labels
```

### 3D Object Representation Strategy

**Placeholder Models**:
- Simple geometric shapes for ships (boxes, cylinders)
- Color coding by team (Player=Blue, Hostile=Red, etc.)
- Directional indicators for object orientation
- Scale indicators for different ship classes

**Waypoint Visualization**:
- Distinctive waypoint markers (spheres, pyramids)
- Waypoint path connections for navigation routes
- Different colors for waypoint types
- Distance and heading information

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Level-of-detail (LOD) for distant objects
- Frustum culling for off-screen objects
- Object pooling for repeated elements
- Efficient mesh generation for placeholders
