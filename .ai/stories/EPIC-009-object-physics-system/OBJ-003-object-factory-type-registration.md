# User Story: Object Factory and Type Registration System

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game system developer  
**I want**: A comprehensive object factory system with type registration and creation templates  
**So that**: Different space object types can be created efficiently with proper configuration and asset integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: SpaceObjectFactory provides unified interface for creating all space object types
- [ ] **AC2**: Object type registration system supports ships, weapons, debris, asteroids, and environmental objects
- [ ] **AC3**: Factory integrates with existing wcs_asset_core addon for loading object configuration data
- [ ] **AC4**: Creation templates define default properties, components, and physics profiles for each object type
- [ ] **AC5**: Factory supports both immediate creation and deferred initialization patterns
- [ ] **AC6**: Error handling and validation ensure only valid objects are created with proper fallbacks

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: SpaceObjectFactory from godot-files.md line 19, integration with wcs_asset_core
- **Godot Components**: Factory pattern implementation, Resource system integration, scene instantiation
- **Performance Targets**: Object creation under 0.2ms for simple objects, under 1ms for complex objects  
- **Integration Points**: wcs_asset_core addon (EPIC-002), ObjectManager registration, BaseSpaceObject

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp` object creation systems and type management
- **Godot Approach**: Factory pattern with Resource-based configuration and scene templates
- **Key Challenges**: Efficient object creation while maintaining flexibility and asset integration
- **Success Metrics**: Fast object creation, proper asset integration, extensible type system

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject class, OBJ-002 enhanced ObjectManager
- **Blockers**: EPIC-002 wcs_asset_core addon must be available for asset integration
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-001 (BaseSpaceObject), OBJ-002 (ObjectManager), OBJ-004 (Serialization)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [ ] Unit tests written covering object creation, type registration, and error handling
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for object creation operations
- [ ] Integration testing with wcs_asset_core addon completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [ ] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for object factory system

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (factory pattern with asset integration)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium (affects all object creation pathways)
