# User Story: Collision Detection and Shape Management System

## Story Definition
**As a**: Collision system developer  
**I want**: High-performance collision detection system with dynamic collision shape management  
**So that**: All space objects can detect collisions accurately while maintaining performance through optimized shape handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Collision detection system handles multiple collision layers (ships, weapons, debris, triggers)
- [ ] **AC2**: Dynamic collision shape generation supports sphere, box, and mesh-based collision shapes
- [ ] **AC3**: Collision filtering system prevents unnecessary collision checks between incompatible objects
- [ ] **AC4**: Multi-level collision detection uses simple shapes for broad phase, complex for narrow phase
- [ ] **AC5**: Collision shape caching optimizes performance by reusing generated collision shapes
- [ ] **AC6**: Integration with Godot's physics engine maintains compatibility while adding WCS-specific features

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Collision detection from architecture.md lines 119-152, collision system components
- **Godot Components**: CollisionShape3D, Area3D, RigidBody3D collision, physics layers and masks
- **Performance Targets**: Collision detection under 1ms for 200 objects, shape generation under 0.1ms  
- **Integration Points**: BaseSpaceObject collision, PhysicsManager, spatial partitioning system

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/objcollide.cpp` collision detection and `model/modelinterp.cpp` collision shapes
- **Godot Approach**: Godot collision system with custom optimization and WCS-specific collision logic
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing collision accuracy with performance for complex space object shapes
- **Success Metrics**: Accurate collision detection, optimal performance, proper collision filtering

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject, OBJ-005 PhysicsManager integration
- **Blockers**: None (uses standard Godot collision capabilities)
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-010 (Collision Response), OBJ-011 (Spatial Partitioning)

## Definition of Done
