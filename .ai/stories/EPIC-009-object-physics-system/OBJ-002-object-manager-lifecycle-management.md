# User Story: Object Manager and Lifecycle Management Enhancement

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game system developer  
**I want**: Enhanced ObjectManager autoload with space object registry and comprehensive lifecycle management  
**So that**: All space objects can be efficiently created, tracked, updated, and destroyed with proper pooling and performance optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Enhanced ObjectManager autoload extends existing EPIC-001 implementation with space object registry
- [ ] **AC2**: Object pooling system supports BaseSpaceObject types with configurable pool sizes
- [ ] **AC3**: Object lifecycle management includes proper initialization, activation, deactivation, and cleanup
- [ ] **AC4**: Update frequency groups optimize object processing based on distance and importance
- [ ] **AC5**: Spatial query system enables efficient "get objects in radius" and proximity detection
- [ ] **AC6**: Object registration and deregistration maintains consistent state and proper cleanup

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Enhanced ObjectManager from architecture.md lines 16-32, godot-dependencies.md lines 8-29
- **Godot Components**: AutoLoad enhancement, object pooling, Dictionary-based spatial tracking
- **Performance Targets**: Object registration under 0.05ms, spatial queries under 1ms for 200 objects  
- **Integration Points**: Existing ObjectManager autoload (EPIC-001), PhysicsManager integration

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp` object management and `globalincs/globals.h` object tracking
- **Godot Approach**: Enhance existing ObjectManager with space-specific features and pooling
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining backward compatibility while adding new space object features
- **Success Metrics**: Efficient object pooling, fast spatial queries, proper lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject foundation class must be implemented
- **Blockers**: EPIC-001 CF-014 ObjectManager must be fully functional
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-001 (BaseSpaceObject), OBJ-003 (Object Factory)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [ ] Unit tests written covering object pooling, lifecycle, and spatial queries
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for object management operations
- [ ] Integration testing with existing ObjectManager autoload completed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [ ] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for enhanced object management

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (building on existing system with new features)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium (affects all object creation and management)
