# User Story: Object Manager and Lifecycle Management Enhancement

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game system developer  
**I want**: Enhanced ObjectManager autoload with space object registry and comprehensive lifecycle management  
**So that**: All space objects can be efficiently created, tracked, updated, and destroyed with proper pooling and performance optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Enhanced ObjectManager autoload extends existing EPIC-001 implementation with space object registry
- [ ] **AC2**: MANDATORY: Object types MUST use `addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/object_types.gd` - NO local type definitions allowed
- [ ] **AC3**: Object pooling system supports BaseSpaceObject types with configurable pool sizes from wcs_asset_core
- [ ] **AC4**: Object lifecycle management includes proper initialization, activation, deactivation, and cleanup
- [ ] **AC5**: Update frequency groups optimize object processing based on distance and importance using EPIC-002 performance constants
- [ ] **AC6**: Spatial query system enables efficient "get objects in radius" and proximity detection
- [ ] **AC7**: Object registration and deregistration maintains consistent state and proper cleanup
- [ ] **AC8**: Integration with EPIC-004 SEXP system for object queries (`get-ship`, `wing-status`, etc.)

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Enhanced ObjectManager from architecture.md lines 16-32, godot-dependencies.md lines 8-29
- **EPIC-002 Integration**: MANDATORY use of wcs_asset_core addon for ALL object type definitions and constants
- **Required Imports**: 
  - `const ObjectTypes = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/object_types.gd")`
  - `const UpdateFrequencies = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/update_frequencies.gd")`
- **Godot Components**: AutoLoad enhancement, object pooling, Dictionary-based spatial tracking
- **Performance Targets**: Object registration under 0.05ms, spatial queries under 1ms for 200 objects  
- **Integration Points**: Existing ObjectManager autoload (EPIC-001), PhysicsManager integration, EPIC-004 SEXP interface

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp` object management and `globalincs/globals.h` object tracking
- **Godot Approach**: Enhance existing ObjectManager with space-specific features and pooling
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining backward compatibility while adding new space object features
- **Success Metrics**: Efficient object pooling, fast spatial queries, proper lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- **CRITICAL Prerequisites**: 
  - OBJ-000 Asset Core Integration Prerequisites (MANDATORY FIRST)
  - OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject foundation class must be implemented
- **Blockers**: EPIC-001 CF-014 ObjectManager must be fully functional
- **Integration Dependencies**:
  - EPIC-002 wcs_asset_core addon with object constants
  - EPIC-004 SEXP system for object query interfaces
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-001 (BaseSpaceObject), OBJ-003 (Object Factory)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [ ] Unit tests written covering object pooling, lifecycle, and spatial queries
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for object management operations
- [ ] Integration testing with existing ObjectManager autoload completed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [ ] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for enhanced object management

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (building on existing system with new features)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium (affects all object creation and management)
