# User Story: Debug Tools and Validation System

## Story Definition
**As a**: Object system developer  
**I want**: Comprehensive debug tools and validation system for the object physics framework  
**So that**: Development, testing, and troubleshooting can be performed efficiently with visual feedback and automated validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Debug visualization tools display object states, physics forces, collision shapes, and spatial partitioning
- [ ] **AC2**: Object validation system checks for state corruption, invalid configurations, and system consistency
- [ ] **AC3**: Debug UI provides real-time monitoring of object counts, performance metrics, and system status
- [ ] **AC4**: Error detection and reporting system identifies and logs object system issues
- [ ] **AC5**: Testing framework supports automated validation of object lifecycle, physics, and collision systems
- [ ] **AC6**: Development tools enable easy object creation, modification, and testing during development

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Debug tools from architecture.md lines 156-168, validation systems
- **Godot Components**: Debug drawing, UI development, error reporting, testing framework integration
- **Performance Targets**: Debug overhead under 1ms when enabled, validation checks under 0.5ms  
- **Integration Points**: All object system components, development UI, testing framework

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Debug and validation systems from WCS development tools
- **Godot Approach**: Godot debug drawing and UI with custom validation and testing tools
- **Key Challenges**: Providing comprehensive debugging without impacting runtime performance
- **Success Metrics**: Effective debugging tools, comprehensive validation, developer productivity

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: All previous object system stories (OBJ-001 through OBJ-015)
- **Blockers**: Complete object framework must be implemented for comprehensive debugging
- **Related Stories**: All object system stories for comprehensive debug coverage

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [ ] Unit tests written covering debug tools, validation systems, and error detection
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for debug systems
- [ ] Integration testing with complete object system and debug scenarios completed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [ ] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for debug and validation system

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (debug tools with comprehensive system coverage)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low (debug tools don't affect core system functionality)
