# User Story: Object Serialization and Persistence System

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game system developer  
**I want**: Robust object serialization and persistence system for save games and mission state  
**So that**: Object states can be saved and restored accurately while maintaining all gameplay-critical data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Object serialization captures all essential BaseSpaceObject state (position, velocity, health, etc.)
- [ ] **AC2**: Serialization system handles object relationships and references between space objects
- [ ] **AC3**: Deserialization recreates objects with identical state and proper scene tree integration
- [ ] **AC4**: System supports incremental saves for performance with only changed objects
- [ ] **AC5**: Validation ensures serialized data integrity and version compatibility
- [ ] **AC6**: Integration with save game system maintains object persistence across game sessions

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Object serialization from godot-files.md lines 102-103, state management
- **Godot Components**: Resource system, JSON serialization, scene persistence, data validation
- **Performance Targets**: Serialization under 2ms per object, deserialization under 5ms per object  
- **Integration Points**: Save game system (EPIC-007), BaseSpaceObject state, ObjectManager

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp` object state management and mission save systems
- **Godot Approach**: Resource-based serialization with custom export logic for complex states
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining object references and relationships across save/load cycles
- **Success Metrics**: Accurate state restoration, performance within targets, data integrity

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject, OBJ-002 ObjectManager, OBJ-003 Object Factory
- **Blockers**: None (uses standard Godot serialization capabilities)
- **Related Stories**: EPIC-007 save game integration, OBJ-002 (ObjectManager state)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [ ] Unit tests written covering serialization, deserialization, and validation
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for save/load operations
- [ ] Integration testing with save game system completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [ ] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for serialization system

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (serialization with object relationships)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Low (uses standard Godot features with custom logic)
