# User Story: Base Game Object System and Node Integration

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game system developer  
**I want**: A foundational BaseSpaceObject class that integrates WCS object concepts with Godot's node system  
**So that**: All space entities (ships, weapons, debris) can be managed through a unified object hierarchy while leveraging Godot's scene tree

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: BaseSpaceObject class extends RigidBody3D and provides WCS object lifecycle management
- [ ] **AC2**: Object creation and destruction follows WCS patterns while working with Godot's scene tree
- [ ] **AC3**: Object ID assignment and tracking system maintains WCS compatibility
- [ ] **AC4**: Object type enumeration covers all WCS object categories (ships, weapons, debris, asteroids, etc.)
- [ ] **AC5**: Signal-based communication system for object lifecycle events (created, destroyed, state_changed)
- [ ] **AC6**: Integration with ObjectManager autoload from EPIC-001 for global object coordination

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: BaseSpaceObject foundation class from architecture.md lines 28-47
- **Godot Components**: RigidBody3D base class, custom Node3D components, signal system
- **Performance Targets**: Object creation under 0.1ms, destruction cleanup under 0.5ms  
- **Integration Points**: ObjectManager autoload (EPIC-001), future PhysicsManager integration

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp`, `object/object.h` - core object management system
- **Godot Approach**: Use RigidBody3D as base with composition pattern for specialized behavior
- **Key Challenges**: Mapping WCS object hierarchy to Godot node relationships
- **Success Metrics**: Clean object lifecycle, proper memory management, signal-based communication

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-001 ObjectManager autoload must be implemented and functional
- **Blockers**: EPIC-001 CF-014 ObjectManager implementation must be complete
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-002 (Object Manager), OBJ-003 (Object Factory)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [ ] Unit tests written covering object creation, destruction, and state management
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for object lifecycle operations
- [ ] Integration testing with ObjectManager autoload completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [ ] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for object system foundation

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (foundational system with multiple integration points)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium (foundational component affects all other object work)
