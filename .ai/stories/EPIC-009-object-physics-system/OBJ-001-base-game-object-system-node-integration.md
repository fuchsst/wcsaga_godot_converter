# User Story: Base Game Object System and Node Integration

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game system developer  
**I want**: A foundational BaseSpaceObject class that integrates WCS object concepts with Godot's node system  
**So that**: All space entities (ships, weapons, debris) can be managed through a unified object hierarchy while leveraging Godot's scene tree

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: BaseSpaceObject class extends WCSObject (EPIC-001) and uses COMPOSITION with RigidBody3D for physics
- [ ] **AC2**: MANDATORY: All object type definitions MUST use wcs_asset_core addon constants (EPIC-002 integration)
- [ ] **AC3**: Object creation and destruction follows WCS patterns while working with Godot's scene tree
- [ ] **AC4**: Object ID assignment and tracking system maintains WCS compatibility with EPIC-001 foundation
- [ ] **AC5**: Object type enumeration uses `addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/object_types.gd` - NO local definitions allowed
- [ ] **AC6**: Collision layers use `addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/collision_layers.gd` for proper physics integration
- [ ] **AC7**: Signal-based communication system for object lifecycle events (created, destroyed, state_changed)
- [ ] **AC8**: Integration with ObjectManager autoload from EPIC-001 for global object coordination

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Updated BaseSpaceObject foundation class from architecture.md (Mo's EPIC-002 corrections)
- **EPIC-002 Integration**: MANDATORY use of wcs_asset_core addon for ALL type definitions and constants
- **Required Imports**: 
  - `const ObjectTypes = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/object_types.gd")`
  - `const CollisionLayers = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/collision_layers.gd")`
  - `const PhysicsProfile = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/object/physics_profile.gd")`
- **Godot Components**: Composition pattern - RigidBody3D as child node, NOT inheritance
- **Performance Targets**: Object creation under 0.1ms, destruction cleanup under 0.5ms  
- **Integration Points**: ObjectManager autoload (EPIC-001), PhysicsManager integration, wcs_asset_core addon

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp`, `object/object.h` - core object management system
- **Godot Approach**: Use RigidBody3D as base with composition pattern for specialized behavior
- **Key Challenges**: Mapping WCS object hierarchy to Godot node relationships
- **Success Metrics**: Clean object lifecycle, proper memory management, signal-based communication

## Dependencies
- **EPIC-001 Prerequisites**: ObjectManager autoload must be implemented and functional
- **EPIC-002 Prerequisites**: wcs_asset_core addon must be enabled and object type constants created
- **CRITICAL**: Before implementation, the following wcs_asset_core files must be created:
  - `addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/object_types.gd` 
  - `addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/collision_layers.gd`
  - `addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/object/physics_profile.gd` (moved from scripts/core/)
- **Blockers**: EPIC-001 CF-014 ObjectManager implementation must be complete
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-002 (Object Manager), OBJ-003 (Object Factory), **NEW**: Asset Core Integration Story (required first)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [ ] Unit tests written covering object creation, destruction, and state management
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for object lifecycle operations
- [ ] Integration testing with ObjectManager autoload completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [ ] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for object system foundation

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (foundational system with multiple integration points)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium (foundational component affects all other object work)
