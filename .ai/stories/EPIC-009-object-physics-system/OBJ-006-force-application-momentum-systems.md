# User Story: Force Application and Momentum Systems

## Story Definition
**As a**: Ship physics developer  
**I want**: Comprehensive force application system with realistic momentum and WCS-style space physics  
**So that**: Ships and objects move with proper inertia, thrust responses, and momentum conservation matching WCS behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Force application system enables realistic thruster physics with proper force vectors
- [ ] **AC2**: Momentum conservation maintains object velocity and angular momentum through collisions
- [ ] **AC3**: PhysicsProfile resources define object-specific physics behavior (damping, mass, thrust response)
- [ ] **AC4**: Force integration system accumulates and applies forces during fixed timestep physics updates
- [ ] **AC5**: Thruster and engine systems produce appropriate force responses for ship movement
- [ ] **AC6**: Physics debugging tools visualize force vectors and momentum for development testing

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Force application from architecture.md lines 64-78, physics profiles system
- **Godot Components**: RigidBody3D force application, Vector3 physics calculations, Resource system
- **Performance Targets**: Force calculation under 0.05ms per object, physics integration under 0.1ms  
- **Integration Points**: Enhanced PhysicsManager, CustomPhysicsBody, BaseSpaceObject

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `physics/physics.cpp` force integration and `ship/ship.cpp` thruster systems
- **Godot Approach**: RigidBody3D force application with custom integration for WCS-style physics
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining WCS physics feel while using Godot's force application systems
- **Success Metrics**: Realistic ship movement, proper momentum conservation, responsive controls

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-005 enhanced PhysicsManager with physics integration
- **Blockers**: CustomPhysicsBody from EPIC-001 must support force application
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-005 (PhysicsManager), OBJ-007 (Physics Step Integration)
