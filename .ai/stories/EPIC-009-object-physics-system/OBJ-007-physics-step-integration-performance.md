# User Story: Physics Step Integration and Performance Optimization

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game performance developer  
**I want**: Optimized physics step integration with LOD systems and update frequency management  
**So that**: Physics simulation maintains 60 FPS performance with hundreds of objects through intelligent update scheduling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Physics step integration runs at stable 60Hz fixed timestep with consistent frame timing
- [ ] **AC2**: LOD system adjusts physics update frequency based on object distance and importance
- [ ] **AC3**: Update frequency groups optimize processing for HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/MINIMAL frequency objects
- [ ] **AC4**: Physics culling system disables physics for very distant or inactive objects
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance monitoring tracks physics step timing and object count impact
- [ ] **AC6**: Automatic optimization adjusts LOD levels based on frame rate performance

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: LOD system from architecture.md lines 207-231, update optimization
- **Godot Components**: Fixed timestep processing, distance calculations, performance monitoring
- **Performance Targets**: Physics step under 2ms for 200 objects, LOD switching under 0.1ms  
- **Integration Points**: Enhanced PhysicsManager, LODManager, update frequency systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `physics/physics.cpp` physics optimization and object management systems
- **Godot Approach**: Godot's fixed timestep with custom LOD and culling systems
