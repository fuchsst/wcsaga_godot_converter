# User Story: Physics State Synchronization and Consistency

## Story Definition
**As a**: Physics system developer  
**I want**: Reliable physics state synchronization between custom WCS physics and Godot physics systems  
**So that**: Object states remain consistent and accurate across different physics processing systems and frame boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Physics state synchronization maintains consistency between CustomPhysicsBody and RigidBody3D
- [ ] **AC2**: State validation ensures physics properties remain within expected ranges and constraints
- [ ] **AC3**: Synchronization handles state conflicts and resolution when custom and Godot physics diverge
- [ ] **AC4**: Performance optimization minimizes synchronization overhead during physics updates
- [ ] **AC5**: Error detection and recovery handles edge cases like NaN values or extreme velocities
- [ ] **AC6**: Debug visualization tools show physics state synchronization status and conflicts

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Physics state sync from architecture.md lines 111-123, CustomPhysicsBody integration
- **Godot Components**: RigidBody3D state management, CustomPhysicsBody coordination, error handling
- **Performance Targets**: State sync under 0.02ms per object, validation under 0.01ms per object  
- **Integration Points**: CustomPhysicsBody (EPIC-001), enhanced PhysicsManager, BaseSpaceObject

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `physics/physics.cpp` state management and validation systems
- **Godot Approach**: Bidirectional synchronization with conflict resolution and validation
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining state consistency while minimizing performance impact
- **Success Metrics**: Zero state corruption, minimal sync overhead, robust error handling

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-005 PhysicsManager, OBJ-006 force application, OBJ-007 physics integration
- **Blockers**: CustomPhysicsBody from EPIC-001 must be fully functional
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-005 (PhysicsManager), OBJ-006 (Force Application)

## Definition of Done
