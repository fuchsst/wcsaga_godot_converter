# User Story: Physics Manager and Godot Integration Enhancement

## Story Definition
**As a**: Game physics developer  
**I want**: Enhanced PhysicsManager autoload with improved Godot physics integration and WCS-style physics behavior  
**So that**: Space objects have realistic physics simulation that maintains WCS feel while leveraging Godot's physics engine

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Enhanced PhysicsManager autoload builds on existing EPIC-001 implementation with space physics features
- [ ] **AC2**: MANDATORY: Physics profiles MUST use `addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/object/physics_profile.gd` exclusively
- [ ] **AC3**: Physics integration coordinates between Godot RigidBody3D physics and custom WCS-style behaviors
- [ ] **AC4**: Fixed timestep physics simulation runs at stable 60Hz with consistent frame timing
- [ ] **AC5**: Physics profiles system allows customization of behavior per object type using wcs_asset_core definitions
- [ ] **AC6**: Force application system enables realistic thruster physics and momentum conservation
- [ ] **AC7**: Physics state synchronization maintains consistency between custom physics and Godot physics
- [ ] **AC8**: Integration with EPIC-004 SEXP system for physics queries (`ship-speed`, `is-moving`, etc.)

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Enhanced PhysicsManager from architecture.md lines 30-50, godot-dependencies.md lines 30-50
- **EPIC-002 Integration**: MANDATORY use of wcs_asset_core addon for ALL physics profile definitions
- **Required Imports**: 
  - `const PhysicsProfile = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/object/physics_profile.gd")`
  - `const ObjectTypes = preload("res://addons/wcs_asset_core/constants/object_types.gd")`
- **Godot Components**: RigidBody3D integration, physics server, fixed timestep processing
- **Performance Targets**: Physics step under 2ms for 200 objects, force application under 0.1ms per object  
- **Integration Points**: Existing PhysicsManager autoload (EPIC-001), CustomPhysicsBody, BaseSpaceObject, EPIC-004 SEXP interface

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `physics/physics.cpp` physics simulation and force application systems
- **Godot Approach**: Hybrid system using Godot physics with WCS behavior customization
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing Godot physics capabilities with WCS physics feel and accuracy
- **Success Metrics**: Stable 60Hz physics, realistic space movement, proper momentum conservation

## Dependencies
- **CRITICAL Prerequisites**: 
  - OBJ-000 Asset Core Integration Prerequisites (MANDATORY FIRST)
  - OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject with physics integration
- **Blockers**: EPIC-001 PhysicsManager autoload must be functional
- **Integration Dependencies**:
  - EPIC-002 wcs_asset_core addon with physics profile resources
  - EPIC-004 SEXP system for physics state queries
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-006 (Force Application), OBJ-007 (Physics Step Integration)

## Definition of Done
