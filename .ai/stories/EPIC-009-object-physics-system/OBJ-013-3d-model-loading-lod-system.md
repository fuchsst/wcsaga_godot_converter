# User Story: 3D Model Loading and LOD System Integration

## Story Definition
**As a**: Graphics integration developer  
**I want**: Seamless 3D model loading and LOD system integration for space objects  
**So that**: Objects can display appropriate visual detail based on distance while maintaining performance through intelligent model management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: 3D model loading integrates with existing EPIC-008 graphics system and wcs_asset_core
- [ ] **AC2**: LOD system automatically switches model detail levels based on distance and importance
- [ ] **AC3**: Model integration supports collision shape generation from 3D mesh data
- [ ] **AC4**: Asset pipeline connects POF model conversion with object visual representation
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance optimization manages model memory usage and rendering load
- [ ] **AC6**: Model subsystem integration supports damage states and visual effects

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Model integration from architecture.md lines 46-53, LOD manager system
- **Godot Components**: MeshInstance3D, LOD management, asset loading, mesh collision generation
- **Performance Targets**: Model loading under 5ms, LOD switching under 0.1ms, memory efficient caching  
- **Integration Points**: EPIC-008 graphics system, wcs_asset_core (EPIC-002), BaseSpaceObject visual

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `model/modelinterp.cpp` and `model/modelread.cpp` 3D model systems
- **Godot Approach**: Integration with existing graphics pipeline and asset management systems
- **Key Challenges**: Efficient model loading while supporting LOD and collision shape generation
- **Success Metrics**: Smooth LOD transitions, efficient model loading, proper collision integration

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-008 graphics system, EPIC-002 wcs_asset_core, OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject
- **Blockers**: EPIC-008 graphics rendering engine must be functional
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-014 (Subsystem Integration), integration with graphics system

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
- [ ] Unit tests written covering model loading, LOD switching, and collision generation
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for model management operations
- [ ] Integration testing with graphics system and asset pipeline completed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by architecture standards
- [ ] CLAUDE.md package documentation updated for model integration system

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium (integration with existing graphics and asset systems)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium (depends on EPIC-008 graphics system functionality)
