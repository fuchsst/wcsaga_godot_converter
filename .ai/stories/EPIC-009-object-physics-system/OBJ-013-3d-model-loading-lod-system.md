# User Story: 3D Model Loading and LOD System Integration

## Story Definition
**As a**: Graphics integration developer  
**I want**: Seamless 3D model loading and LOD system integration for space objects  
**So that**: Objects can display appropriate visual detail based on distance while maintaining performance through intelligent model management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: 3D model loading integrates seamlessly with existing EPIC-008 Graphics Rendering Engine ✅
- [x] **AC2**: MANDATORY: Model assets MUST use `addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/object/model_metadata.gd` for definitions ✅
- [x] **AC3**: LOD system automatically switches model detail levels based on distance and importance using EPIC-008 LOD manager ✅
- [x] **AC4**: Model integration supports collision shape generation from 3D mesh data ✅
- [x] **AC5**: Asset pipeline connects POF model conversion with object visual representation through EPIC-008 texture system ✅
- [x] **AC6**: Performance optimization manages model memory usage and rendering load using EPIC-008 performance monitoring ✅
- [x] **AC7**: Model subsystem integration supports damage states and visual effects through EPIC-008 shader system ✅
- [x] **AC8**: Integration with EPIC-004 SEXP system for dynamic model changes (`change-ship-model`, etc.) ✅

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Model integration from architecture.md lines 46-53, LOD manager system
- **EPIC-008 Integration**: MANDATORY use of EPIC-008 Graphics Rendering Engine for ALL model operations
- **Required Systems**: 
  - EPIC-008 GraphicsManager for model rendering coordination
  - EPIC-008 LODManager for distance-based detail switching
  - EPIC-008 TextureManager for model texture loading
  - EPIC-008 PerformanceMonitor for optimization
- **EPIC-002 Integration**: Model definitions MUST use wcs_asset_core addon model resources
- **Godot Components**: MeshInstance3D, LOD management, asset loading, mesh collision generation
- **Performance Targets**: Model loading under 5ms, LOD switching under 0.1ms, memory efficient caching  
- **Integration Points**: EPIC-008 graphics system, wcs_asset_core (EPIC-002), BaseSpaceObject visual, EPIC-004 SEXP interface

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `model/modelinterp.cpp` and `model/modelread.cpp` 3D model systems
- **Godot Approach**: Integration with existing graphics pipeline and asset management systems
- **Key Challenges**: Efficient model loading while supporting LOD and collision shape generation
- **Success Metrics**: Smooth LOD transitions, efficient model loading, proper collision integration

## Dependencies
- **CRITICAL Prerequisites**: 
  - OBJ-000 Asset Core Integration Prerequisites (MANDATORY FIRST)
  - EPIC-008 Graphics Rendering Engine (IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅)
  - EPIC-002 wcs_asset_core, OBJ-001 BaseSpaceObject
- **Blockers**: EPIC-008 graphics rendering engine must be functional (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Integration Dependencies**:
  - EPIC-008 GraphicsManager, LODManager, TextureManager, PerformanceMonitor
  - EPIC-002 wcs_asset_core addon with model metadata resources
  - EPIC-004 SEXP system for dynamic model manipulation

## Implementation Status
**✅ COMPLETED** - All requirements implemented and validated

## Implementation Summary
- **5 Core Classes Created**: ModelIntegrationSystem, ModelLODManager, ModelCollisionGenerator, ModelSubsystemIntegration, ModelSexpIntegration
- **Performance Targets Met**: 5ms model loading, 0.1ms LOD switching validated
- **Complete EPIC Integration**: EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-004, EPIC-008 systems integrated
