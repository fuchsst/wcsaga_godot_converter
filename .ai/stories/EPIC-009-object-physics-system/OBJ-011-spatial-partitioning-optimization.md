# User Story: Spatial Partitioning and Performance Optimization

## Story Definition
**As a**: Performance optimization developer  
**I want**: Advanced spatial partitioning system with efficient object queries and collision optimization  
**So that**: Object proximity queries and collision detection maintain performance with hundreds of objects through intelligent spatial organization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Spatial hash system organizes objects into grid-based spatial partitions for fast queries
- [ ] **AC2**: Object query system supports "get objects in radius" and proximity detection efficiently
- [ ] **AC3**: Collision optimization uses spatial partitioning to reduce unnecessary collision checks
- [ ] **AC4**: Dynamic partitioning adapts grid size based on object density and distribution
- [ ] **AC5**: Query caching system stores frequently requested spatial queries for performance
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance monitoring tracks spatial query efficiency and optimization effectiveness

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Spatial partitioning from architecture.md lines 234-249, optimization systems
- **Godot Components**: Dictionary-based spatial hash, Vector3 calculations, performance monitoring
- **Performance Targets**: Spatial queries under 0.5ms for typical scenarios, partitioning under 0.1ms per object  
- **Integration Points**: ObjectManager spatial queries, collision detection optimization, LOD systems

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/object.cpp` spatial optimization and object management systems
- **Godot Approach**: Custom spatial hash implementation with Godot's spatial optimization features
- **Key Challenges**: Balancing spatial partition granularity with query performance and memory usage
- **Success Metrics**: Fast spatial queries, reduced collision checks, scalable performance with object count

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-002 ObjectManager enhancement, OBJ-009 collision detection
- **Blockers**: None (custom implementation using standard algorithms)
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-002 (ObjectManager), OBJ-009 (Collision Detection), OBJ-015 (Performance)
