# User Story: Collision Response and Damage Calculation System

## Story Definition
**As a**: Combat system developer  
**I want**: Comprehensive collision response system with accurate damage calculation and physics effects  
**So that**: Object collisions produce realistic damage, physics responses, and visual effects matching WCS behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Collision response system calculates damage based on relative velocity, mass, and object types
- [ ] **AC2**: Physics response applies appropriate impulses and forces for realistic collision reactions
- [ ] **AC3**: Damage calculation integrates with armor systems and object health management
- [ ] **AC4**: Collision effects trigger appropriate visual and audio feedback through event system
- [ ] **AC5**: Special collision handling for different object combinations (ship-weapon, ship-asteroid, etc.)
- [ ] **AC6**: Performance optimization ensures collision response doesn't impact frame rate during intense scenarios

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Collision response from architecture.md lines 130-152, damage calculation system
- **Godot Components**: RigidBody3D collision response, signal system, effect triggering
- **Performance Targets**: Damage calculation under 0.1ms per collision, response processing under 0.2ms  
- **Integration Points**: BaseSpaceObject health, PhysicsManager, effects system (EPIC-008)

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object/objcollide.cpp` collision response and damage calculation systems
- **Godot Approach**: Signal-based collision handling with custom damage calculation logic
- **Key Challenges**: Accurate damage calculation while maintaining performance during multi-collisions
- **Success Metrics**: Realistic collision responses, accurate damage calculation, proper effect triggering

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: OBJ-009 collision detection system
- **Blockers**: BaseSpaceObject health system must be implemented
- **Related Stories**: OBJ-009 (Collision Detection), integration with EPIC-008 effects system

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through automated tests
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards with full static typing and documentation
