# AI-003: Weapon Systems Foundation

## User Story
**As a** developer implementing WCS combat systems  
**I need** a functional weapon system that can fire projectiles and handle combat  
**So that** ships can engage in space combat using authentic WCS weapon mechanics

## Epic
Asset Integration & Validation

High

## Complexity
Medium-High (3-4 days effort)

## Risk Level
Medium - Complex projectile physics and weapon mechanics

## Dependencies
- AI-002: Basic Ship Instantiation System (Must be completed first)

## Technical Scope

### Weapon Factory System

### Projectile System
- Create WCSProjectile class for bullets, lasers, and missiles
- Implement projectile physics (velocity, lifetime, homing)
- Add projectile pooling for performance (hundreds of simultaneous projectiles)
- Handle collision detection and damage application

### Weapon Controller
- Create WCSWeapon class for individual weapon instances
- Implement firing mechanics (rate of fire, energy consumption, heat)
- Add weapon states (ready, firing, reloading, overheated)
- Support different firing patterns (single, burst, continuous)

### Combat Integration
- Integrate weapons with ship HealthComponent for damage
- Add weapon targeting and lock-on systems

## Performance Targets
- Weapon firing latency: <5ms from input to projectile spawn
- Projectile update rate: 60Hz for 500+ simultaneous projectiles
- Memory usage: <50MB for intense combat scenario
- Frame rate: >60fps with 20+ ships in active combat
- Collision detection: <2ms per frame for all projectiles

## WCS Weapon Mechanics to Preserve
- **Energy Weapons**: Instant hit with energy consumption
- **Missile Weapons**: Homing with turn rate and lock time
- **Beam Weapons**: Continuous damage with energy drain
- **Weapon Linking**: Multiple weapons fire as group
- **Heat Buildup**: Weapons overheat with continuous use
- **Ammunition**: Limited ammo for secondary weapons

## Integration Points
- **ObjectManager**: Weapon and projectile lifecycle
- **PhysicsManager**: Projectile physics and collision
- **AssetManager**: Weapon models, sounds, and effects
- **Ship Systems**: Energy management and hardpoint mounting
- **Audio System**: Weapon firing and impact sounds

## Component Interaction Example
```gdscript
# Ship fires primary weapons at target
var ship: WCSShip = get_player_ship()
var weapon_component: WeaponComponent = ship.get_component("Weapons")
var target: WCSShip = get_nearest_enemy()

weapon_component.set_target(target)
weapon_component.fire_primary_weapons()

# Weapon creates projectile
var weapon: WCSWeapon = weapon_component.get_primary_weapon(0)
var projectile: WCSProjectile = weapon.fire_projectile(target.global_position)
```

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Projectile pooling and efficient collision detection
- **Physics Accuracy**: Test against WCS reference behavior
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of projectiles and effects
- **Complexity**: Modular weapon system for easy extension
- **Balance**: Preserve WCS weapon balance and feel
