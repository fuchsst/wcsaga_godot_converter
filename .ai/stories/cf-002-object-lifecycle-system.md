# User Story: Object Lifecycle Management System

**Epic**: Core Foundation Systems  
**Story ID**: CF-002  
**Created**: January 25, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: Developer implementing game objects (ships, weapons, etc.)  
**I want**: A robust object creation, tracking, and destruction system  
**So that**: Game objects can be managed efficiently without memory leaks or performance issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Object creation system supports 1000+ simultaneous objects without performance degradation
- [ ] **AC2**: Object pooling implemented for frequently created/destroyed objects (bullets, particles)
- [ ] **AC3**: Update scheduling system groups objects by frequency (60Hz, 30Hz, 10Hz, 1Hz)
- [ ] **AC4**: Automatic cleanup removes objects when no longer referenced
- [ ] **AC5**: Type-safe object creation APIs prevent runtime errors
- [ ] **AC6**: Object registry allows finding objects by ID, type, or other criteria

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/wcs-core-foundation-architecture.md` - ObjectManager section
- **Godot Components**: ObjectManager singleton, WCSObject base scene, object pools
- **Performance Targets**: Support 1000+ objects, <2ms per frame for object updates
- **Integration Points**: All game systems use ObjectManager for entity management

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `object.cpp` object system, manual lifecycle management
- **Godot Approach**: Node-based composition with automatic memory management
- **Key Challenges**: Performance with large object counts, proper cleanup timing
- **Success Metrics**: 1000 objects maintain 60 FPS, no memory leaks in stress tests

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: CF-001 (Core Manager Infrastructure Setup)
- **Blockers**: None
- **Related Stories**: All gameplay object stories depend on this

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows GDScript standards (static typing, documentation)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Performance targets achieved and validated
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, API docs, user docs)
- [ ] Stress testing with 1000+ objects passes performance requirements

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create WCSObject base scene with standardized interface
- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement object creation and registration system
- [ ] **Task 3**: Build object pooling system for reusable objects
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create update scheduling with frequency grouping
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement object cleanup and automatic memory management
- [ ] **Task 6**: Build object registry with search and filter capabilities
- [ ] **Task 7**: Performance testing and optimization

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Object creation/destruction, pooling, registry lookups
- **Integration Tests**: Object manager integration with other core systems
- **Performance Tests**: 1000+ object stress test, memory leak detection
- **Manual Tests**: Object lifecycle visualization, memory usage monitoring

## Notes and Comments
Critical for all gameplay systems. Performance is paramount - this system will be used constantly during gameplay. Object pooling is essential for bullets and particles.
