# User Story: Asset Organization and Cataloging

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-003  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: An intelligent asset organization and cataloging system that creates a comprehensive asset database with searchable metadata  
**So that**: All converted WCS assets are properly indexed, discoverable, and organized for efficient use by the EPIC-002 asset management system and GFRED2 editor

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Generate comprehensive asset catalog database containing all converted assets with type classification, metadata, dependencies, and file paths
- [ ] **AC2**: Create hierarchical asset organization structure matching WCS categories (ships/terran, ships/vassudan, weapons/primary, etc.) with proper subcategorization
- [ ] **AC3**: Extract and preserve asset metadata including dimensions, file sizes, creation dates, version information, and WCS-specific properties
- [ ] **AC4**: Establish asset relationship mapping tracking ship-to-weapon compatibility, texture-to-model associations, and mission asset dependencies
- [ ] **AC5**: Generate searchable asset index supporting queries by name, type, category, tags, and metadata properties with performance optimization
- [ ] **AC6**: Create asset validation reports identifying missing dependencies, broken references, and conversion quality issues with actionable recommendations

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - GodotProjectIntegrator.organize_converted_assets() (lines 747-782) and ValidationSystem (lines 822-896)
- **Python Components**: Database management, metadata extraction, relationship mapping, search indexing, validation reporting
- **Integration Points**: Integrates with EPIC-002 WCSAssetRegistry for runtime asset discovery and GFRED2 asset browser

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/ship/ship.cpp`, `source/code/weapon/weapons.cpp` for asset relationship definitions
- **Database Approach**: JSON-based catalog with SQLite backend for complex queries and relationship mapping
- **Godot Approach**: Generate asset registry compatible with EPIC-002 asset management system architecture
- **Key Challenges**: Preserving complex asset relationships, handling missing assets, ensuring catalog accuracy and completeness
- **Success Metrics**: Catalog 1000+ assets with 100% metadata accuracy, enable sub-second search queries, and maintain relationship integrity

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: DM-002 (VP to Godot Resource Conversion) must be completed with organized asset structure
- **Blockers**: Access to asset relationship definitions, complete converted asset collection
- **Related Stories**: Feeds into Phase 3 POF Model Conversion and Mission File Conversion for dependency resolution

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of cataloging, indexing, and validation functions
- [ ] Integration testing completed with EPIC-002 asset registry system
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including catalog schema and API reference
- [ ] Feature validated by successful asset discovery through EPIC-002 asset management system

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days (data processing and indexing focus, building on existing converted assets)
- **Risk Level**: Low (processing already converted assets, well-defined data structures)
- **Confidence**: High (clear requirements and existing asset structure to work with)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design and implement asset catalog database schema with comprehensive metadata fields
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create asset metadata extraction system analyzing converted files and preserving WCS properties
- [ ] **Task 3**: Build asset relationship mapper tracking dependencies and compatibility matrices
- [ ] **Task 4**: Develop search indexing system with optimized query performance and filtering capabilities
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement validation system identifying asset issues and generating quality reports
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create EPIC-002 registry integration exporting catalog data for runtime asset discovery

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Metadata extraction accuracy, relationship mapping correctness, search query performance
- **Integration Tests**: EPIC-002 asset registry integration, catalog completeness validation
- **Manual Tests**: Search functionality verification, asset browser integration, performance testing with large asset sets

## Notes and Comments
This story establishes the foundation for all asset discovery and management functionality. The catalog becomes the single source of truth for asset metadata and relationships, critical for both runtime asset loading and editor asset browsing functionality.
