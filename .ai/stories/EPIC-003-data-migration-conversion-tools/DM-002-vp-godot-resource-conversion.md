# User Story: VP to Godot Resource Conversion

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-002  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: An intelligent conversion system that processes extracted VP archive contents and converts them to appropriate Godot resource formats  
**So that**: WCS assets are automatically organized and converted to Godot-native formats that integrate seamlessly with the EPIC-002 asset management system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Automatically detect asset types from extracted VP files (POF models, textures, audio, missions) and route to appropriate converters
- [ ] **AC2**: Convert texture files (PCX, TGA, DDS, PNG, JPG) to Godot-optimized formats with proper import settings and metadata preservation
- [ ] **AC3**: Create Godot resource files (.tres) for asset metadata using EPIC-002 BaseAssetData structure with proper type classification
- [ ] **AC4**: Generate organized directory structure in Godot project (models/, textures/, audio/, missions/) following Godot best practices
- [ ] **AC5**: Create .import files for all converted assets with appropriate Godot import settings and optimization flags
- [ ] **AC6**: Produce conversion manifest file documenting source-to-target mappings, conversion statistics, and asset relationship preservation

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - GodotProjectIntegrator class (lines 736-896) and TextureConverter (lines 622-734)
- **Python Components**: Asset type detection, file format converters, Godot import file generators, directory organizers
- **Integration Points**: Uses EPIC-002 asset structures, feeds converted resources to asset loader system

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/bmpman/bmpman.cpp`, `source/code/model/modelread.cpp` for asset format specifications
- **Asset Type Detection**: Use file extensions and header analysis to determine conversion strategy
- **Godot Approach**: Generate proper .import files enabling seamless Godot editor integration and automatic reimport
- **Key Challenges**: Maintaining asset relationships, preserving metadata, handling various texture compression formats
- **Success Metrics**: Convert 500+ assets with 100% successful import in Godot editor and <1% manual correction needed

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: DM-001 (VP Archive Extraction System) must be completed, EPIC-002 asset structures available
- **Blockers**: ImageMagick or similar tool for texture conversion, access to asset format specifications
- **Related Stories**: DM-003 (Asset Organization and Cataloging) uses the organized structure created by this story

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of asset detection, conversion, and Godot integration
- [ ] Integration testing completed with actual converted assets loading in Godot
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including supported formats and conversion mapping
- [ ] Feature validated by successfully importing converted assets in Godot project

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days (multiple format support, Godot integration complexity, comprehensive asset handling)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (dependent on format conversion tools and Godot import system understanding)
- **Confidence**: High (well-documented Godot import system and clear architecture design)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement asset type detection system using file extensions and header analysis
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create texture conversion pipeline supporting 5 image formats with optimization
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop Godot .import file generator with format-specific settings
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build directory organizer maintaining logical asset grouping and relationships
- [ ] **Task 5**: Create EPIC-002 resource file generators for asset metadata
- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement conversion manifest system for tracking and validation

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Asset type detection accuracy, format conversion correctness, import file generation validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end VP extraction to Godot import with verification in Godot editor
- **Manual Tests**: Load converted assets in Godot project, verify visual fidelity and performance

## Notes and Comments
This story bridges raw VP archive data with the Godot project structure. Focus on maintaining asset relationships and metadata to ensure seamless integration with EPIC-002 asset management. The conversion manifest is critical for validation and troubleshooting.
