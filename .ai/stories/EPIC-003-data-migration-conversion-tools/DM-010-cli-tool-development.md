# User Story: CLI Tool Development

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-010  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: A comprehensive command-line interface tool that orchestrates the entire WCS asset conversion pipeline with batch processing and automation capabilities  
**So that**: I can efficiently convert complete WCS installations with minimal manual intervention while maintaining full control over the conversion process

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Provide command-line interface with comprehensive options for source path, target path, conversion types, parallel processing, and validation controls
- [ ] **AC2**: Implement batch processing capability converting entire WCS directories with automatic asset discovery, dependency resolution, and progress tracking
- [ ] **AC3**: Support resume functionality for interrupted conversions using state files and checkpoint system to enable incremental processing
- [ ] **AC4**: Generate detailed conversion reports including statistics, errors, warnings, and performance metrics with exportable formats
- [ ] **AC5**: Provide dry-run mode showing conversion plan without execution and validation mode with comprehensive asset verification
- [ ] **AC6**: Integrate all conversion components (VP extraction, POF conversion, mission translation) into unified workflow with proper error handling

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - Main Conversion Script (lines 902-989) and ConversionManager (lines 78-208)
- **Python Components**: CLI argument parser, conversion orchestrator, progress tracking, state management, reporting system
- **Integration Points**: Coordinates all DM-001 through DM-009 conversion components, outputs to Godot project structure

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: Complete WCS installation structure for comprehensive asset discovery and conversion planning
- **CLI Design**: User-friendly interface with clear options, helpful error messages, and comprehensive documentation
- **Godot Approach**: Generate complete Godot project with proper structure, import settings, and asset organization
- **Key Challenges**: Workflow orchestration, error recovery, performance optimization, user experience design
- **Success Metrics**: Convert complete WCS installation (1000+ assets) in under 2 hours with minimal user intervention

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: All previous DM stories (DM-001 through DM-009) completed with functional conversion components
- **Blockers**: Complete understanding of conversion workflow, testing with full WCS installation
- **Related Stories**: Integrates outputs from all previous conversion stories into unified tool

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of CLI parsing, workflow orchestration, and error handling
- [ ] Integration testing completed with full WCS installation conversion
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including complete CLI reference and usage examples
- [ ] Feature validated by successfully converting complete WCS installation with functional Godot output

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days (workflow integration, CLI design, comprehensive testing requirements)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (dependent on integration of all conversion components and workflow reliability)
- **Confidence**: High (building on established conversion components with clear architecture)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement CLI interface with comprehensive argument parsing and help system
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create conversion orchestrator managing workflow execution and component integration
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop progress tracking and reporting system with real-time updates
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build state management system enabling resume functionality and checkpointing
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement batch processing with automatic asset discovery and dependency resolution
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create validation and reporting system with comprehensive conversion analysis

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: CLI argument parsing, workflow orchestration, state management, error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Full conversion workflow with complete WCS installation
- **Manual Tests**: User experience testing, performance validation, error recovery verification

## Notes and Comments
This CLI tool represents the primary interface for WCS asset conversion. Focus on user experience, reliability, and comprehensive error handling. The tool should be robust enough for production use while providing clear feedback and control options.
