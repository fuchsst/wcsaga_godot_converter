# User Story: Mission File Format Conversion

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-007  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: A comprehensive mission file converter that transforms FS2 mission files into Godot scene format with proper object placement and event system integration  
**So that**: WCS missions can be played in the Godot engine with accurate mission flow, objectives, and scripted events preserved from the original

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Parse FS2 mission file format extracting mission info, ships, wings, waypoints, events, goals, and briefing data with complete fidelity
- [ ] **AC2**: Convert ship and wing definitions to Godot scene objects with proper positioning, orientation, and initial state configuration
- [ ] **AC3**: Transform mission events and goals into GDScript equivalents preserving trigger conditions and action sequences
- [ ] **AC4**: Generate Godot .tscn scene files with proper node hierarchy representing mission layout and object relationships
- [ ] **AC5**: Create mission resource files (.tres) containing mission metadata, objectives, and configuration data for runtime use
- [ ] **AC6**: Produce SEXP expression mapping documenting the conversion of mission scripting logic for validation and troubleshooting

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - MissionFileConverter (lines 468-619) with focus on FS2 parsing and GDScript generation
- **Python Components**: FS2 mission parser, scene generator, SEXP converter, mission resource creator, validation system
- **Integration Points**: Coordinates with EPIC-004 (SEXP Expression System), uses converted assets from DM-003, outputs to GFRED2 editor

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/mission/missionparse.cpp` for complete FS2 mission format specification and parsing logic
- **Mission Structure**: Convert FS2 sections (mission info, objects, events, goals, messages, briefing) to Godot equivalents
- **Godot Approach**: Generate .tscn scenes with mission controller script handling objectives and events
- **Key Challenges**: SEXP expression conversion, object reference resolution, maintaining mission timing and logic
- **Success Metrics**: Convert 20+ missions with 90%+ event accuracy and successful playability in Godot

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: DM-003 (Asset Organization) for ship/weapon references, basic understanding of SEXP system for event conversion
- **Blockers**: Access to FS2 mission files, SEXP conversion strategy definition
- **Related Stories**: Closely coordinates with EPIC-004 SEXP stories for mission scripting conversion

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of FS2 parsing, scene generation, and resource creation
- [ ] Integration testing completed with converted missions loading and running in Godot
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including FS2 format reference and conversion mapping
- [ ] Feature validated by successfully playing converted missions with functional objectives

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Complex
- **Effort**: 3 days (complex mission format, SEXP integration, scene generation requirements)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (dependent on SEXP conversion accuracy and mission logic preservation)
- **Confidence**: High (well-documented FS2 format and clear architecture design)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement FS2 mission file parser handling all mission sections with proper data extraction
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create scene object generator converting ships/wings to Godot nodes with positioning
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop mission event converter transforming FS2 events to GDScript function calls
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build Godot scene file generator creating proper .tscn structure with mission controller
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement mission resource creator generating .tres files for mission metadata
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create validation system ensuring mission conversion accuracy and completeness

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: FS2 parsing accuracy, object conversion correctness, scene file validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end mission conversion with playability testing in Godot
- **Manual Tests**: Mission objective verification, event trigger testing, visual mission layout validation

## Notes and Comments
Mission conversion is critical for preserving the WCS gameplay experience. Focus on maintaining mission logic accuracy while adapting to Godot's event and scripting systems. The SEXP conversion component is particularly important and should coordinate closely with EPIC-004.
