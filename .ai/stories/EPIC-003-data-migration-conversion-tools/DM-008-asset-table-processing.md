# User Story: Asset Table Processing

**Epic**: EPIC-003 - Data Migration & Conversion Tools  
**Story ID**: DM-008  
**Created**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: Ready

## Story Definition
**As a**: WCS-Godot conversion developer  
**I want**: A comprehensive asset table processor that converts WCS data tables (ship classes, weapon definitions, armor specs) into EPIC-002 compatible Godot resource files  
**So that**: All WCS game balance data, specifications, and configuration is accurately preserved and accessible through the Godot asset management system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Parse WCS table files (.tbl) extracting ship classes, weapon definitions, armor specifications, and faction data with complete property preservation
- [ ] **AC2**: Convert parsed table data to EPIC-002 BaseAssetData resource format (ShipData, WeaponData, ArmorData) maintaining all gameplay-critical properties
- [ ] **AC3**: Generate Godot .tres resource files with proper type classification and metadata for seamless integration with asset management system
- [ ] **AC4**: Create asset relationship mapping preserving ship-weapon compatibility, faction associations, and balance dependencies
- [ ] **AC5**: Validate converted data ensuring all numerical values, strings, and boolean flags match original specifications with data integrity verification
- [ ] **AC6**: Produce conversion summary reports documenting table processing statistics, data mappings, and any conversion adjustments or warnings

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: EPIC-003 Architecture - TableDataConverter and asset processing components (not explicitly detailed but referenced)
- **Python Components**: Table file parser, data structure converter, resource file generator, validation system, relationship mapper
- **Integration Points**: Uses EPIC-002 asset data structures, integrates with DM-003 asset cataloging, feeds converted data to asset management system

## Implementation Notes
- **WCS Reference**: `source/code/ship/ship.cpp`, `source/code/weapon/weapons.cpp` for data structure definitions and table parsing logic
- **Table Format**: WCS uses structured text format with sections, properties, and nested data requiring careful parsing
- **Godot Approach**: Generate .tres resource files using EPIC-002 asset classes ensuring proper type safety and validation
- **Key Challenges**: Preserving complex data relationships, handling missing or invalid data, maintaining balance accuracy
- **Success Metrics**: Convert 500+ table entries with 100% data accuracy and successful asset system integration

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: EPIC-002 asset structures available, understanding of WCS table format and data relationships
- **Blockers**: Access to WCS table files, complete data structure mappings
- **Related Stories**: DM-003 (Asset Organization) uses the generated resource files for cataloging and indexing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code follows Python standards (type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing with coverage of table parsing, data conversion, and validation
- [ ] Integration testing completed with converted resources loading successfully in EPIC-002 system
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Documentation updated including table format specification and conversion mapping
- [ ] Feature validated by comparing converted data with original WCS specifications

## Estimation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2 days (structured data processing, building on established asset conversion patterns)
- **Risk Level**: Low (well-defined data structures and clear conversion target format)
- **Confidence**: High (straightforward data transformation with clear validation criteria)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement WCS table file parser handling structured text format with section and property extraction
- [ ] **Task 2**: Create data structure converter mapping WCS properties to EPIC-002 resource fields
- [ ] **Task 3**: Develop resource file generator creating proper .tres files with complete metadata
- [ ] **Task 4**: Build relationship mapper preserving ship-weapon compatibility and faction associations
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement validation system ensuring data accuracy and completeness
- [ ] **Task 6**: Create reporting system documenting conversion statistics and data quality metrics

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Table parsing accuracy, data conversion correctness, resource file validation
- **Integration Tests**: EPIC-002 asset system integration, asset loading verification
- **Manual Tests**: Data accuracy verification against original WCS specifications, balance validation

## Notes and Comments
Asset table conversion is critical for preserving WCS game balance and specifications. Focus on maintaining exact numerical accuracy for all gameplay-affecting properties. The converted data becomes the foundation for all ship and weapon behavior in the converted game.
