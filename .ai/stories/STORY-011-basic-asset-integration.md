# User Story: Basic Asset Integration

**Epic**: EPIC-002 (FRED2 Mission Editor)  
**Story ID**: STORY-011  
**Phase**: 2 (Essential Editing)  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Story Points**: 10  
**Assignee**: Dev (GDScript Developer)  
**Status**: Ready  
**Created**: 2025-01-26  

## Story Definition
**As a**: Mission creator using the FRED2 mission editor  
**I want**: A comprehensive asset browser and integration system that seamlessly connects WCS ship classes, weapon types, and other game assets to the mission editor  
**So that**: I can efficiently select, preview, and configure ships and weapons for mission objects without manually typing asset names or searching through files

## Background Context

The current Mission Object Management System (STORY-008) and Object Property Inspector (STORY-010) provide object creation and property editing capabilities, but lack integration with WCS asset systems. Mission creators need access to ship classes, weapon loadouts, and other assets that exist in the WCS asset pipeline to create realistic and balanced missions.

This story establishes the foundation for asset integration that will be enhanced by the full WCS Asset Pipeline (EPIC-003) but provides immediate value with basic ship/weapon browsing and selection.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-011-1: Asset Browser Foundation
```gherkin
Given I am editing a mission object that requires asset selection
When I open the asset browser for ship classes or weapons
Then I should see a categorized browser with:
  - Ship classes organized by faction (Terran, Kilrathi, Shivan)
  - Weapon types organized by category (Primary, Secondary, Turret)
  - Asset thumbnails or icons where available
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Basic asset information (name, description, technical stats)
And the browser should load within 500ms for typical asset counts
```

### AC-011-2: Ship Class Integration
```gherkin
Given I am creating or editing a ship object
When I select a ship class from the asset browser
Then the system should:
  - Apply the ship class properties to the object
  - Update the object's 3D model representation
  - Configure default weapon loadouts and subsystems
  - Set appropriate physics and AI parameters
  - Validate compatibility with current mission requirements
And all changes should be reflected in the Object Property Inspector
```

### AC-011-3: Weapon Asset Integration
```gherkin
Given I am configuring weapon loadouts for a ship
When I select weapons from the asset browser
Then the system should:
  - Validate weapon compatibility with ship hardpoints
  - Apply weapon bank configurations automatically
  - Update weapon-specific properties (ammo, firing rate, etc.)
  - Show visual feedback for invalid weapon assignments
  - Maintain weapon balance validation warnings
And weapon changes should propagate to related SEXP expressions
```

### AC-011-4: Asset Validation and Error Handling
```gherkin
Given I am working with asset assignments
When asset files are missing, invalid, or incompatible
Then the system should:
  - Display clear error messages with asset status
  - Provide fallback to default/placeholder assets
  - Show asset dependency warnings in real-time
  - Suggest alternative compatible assets when available
  - Log asset issues for debugging and resolution
And the mission should remain editable despite asset issues
```

### AC-011-5: Asset Preview and Information
```gherkin
Given I am browsing available assets
When I select or hover over an asset in the browser
Then I should see:
  - 3D model preview or 2D thumbnail image
  - Technical specifications (hitpoints, speed, armament)
  - Faction and role information
  - Asset file status and availability
  - Usage recommendations and compatibility notes
And preview updates should be responsive (<200ms)
```

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Reference
- **Architecture Document**: `.ai/docs/fred2-mission-editor-architecture.md` - Editor UI Architecture section
- **AssetBrowser Component**: Dockable panel integration with main mission editor
- **Asset Integration Points**: MissionObjectData → ship_class, weapon_loadout properties

### Godot Components
- **AssetBrowserDock**: EditorPlugin dock for asset browsing and selection
- **AssetPreviewPanel**: 3D model/image preview with technical information
- **AssetCategoryTree**: Hierarchical asset organization (ships, weapons, etc.)
- **AssetValidator**: Real-time validation of asset assignments and compatibility
- **AssetIntegrationManager**: Autoload singleton for asset system coordination

### Integration Points
- **MissionObjectManager**: Asset assignment triggers object property updates
- **ObjectPropertyInspector**: Asset-related properties use asset browser for selection
- **AssetManager Autoload**: Integration with global asset management system
- **ValidationSystem**: Asset compatibility validation integration

## Implementation Notes

### WCS Reference
- **Ship Class System**: `source/code/ship/ship.h` - Ship_info struct definitions
- **Weapon System**: `source/code/weapon/weapons.cpp` - Weapon_info and Weapon_class_info
- **Asset Tables**: `source/code/globalincs/def_files.h` - Default asset file definitions
- **FRED2 Integration**: `source/code/fred2/ship_select.cpp` - Original ship selection UI

### Godot Approach
- **Resource-Based Assets**: Convert WCS ship_info/weapon_info to Godot Resources
- **FileSystem Integration**: Use Godot's FileSystemDock patterns for familiar UX
- **Signal-Based Updates**: Asset selection triggers signals for property updates
- **Scene-Based Previews**: Use SubViewport for 3D asset previews

### Key Challenges
- **Asset Data Migration**: Convert WCS binary table data to Godot-accessible format
- **Preview Performance**: Efficient 3D model loading and rendering for previews
- **Compatibility Validation**: Complex ship/weapon compatibility matrix validation
- **Integration Timing**: Coordinate with planned Asset Pipeline (EPIC-003) for future enhancement

### Success Metrics
- **Mission Creation Speed**: 40% faster ship/weapon selection compared to manual entry
- **Asset Discovery**: Mission creators can find and use 90% of available assets
- **Error Reduction**: 50% fewer asset-related mission validation errors
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on asset browsing and selection workflow

## Updated Implementation Notes
**⚠️ Implementation Dependency**: This story implementation is **BLOCKED** until EPIC-003 Asset Structures and Management Addon is completed. The asset browser will integrate with the centralized asset registry and loading systems rather than implementing its own asset management.

Once EPIC-003 is completed, this story will be updated to:
- Use shared asset data structures from the addon
- Integrate with centralized asset loading and validation
- Leverage the asset registry for discovery and browsing
- Avoid code duplication with main game asset systems
