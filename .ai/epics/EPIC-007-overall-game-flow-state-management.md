### Integration Points with Existing Systems
- **EPIC-001**: Foundation systems (GameStateManager, SaveGameManager, ConfigurationManager)
- **EPIC-006**: Menu & Navigation System (PilotSystemCoordinator, UIThemeManager)
- **EPIC-004**: SEXP Expression System (campaign variables and branching logic)
- **EPIC-002**: Asset Management (WCSAssetLoader for campaign and mission assets)
- **All Game Systems**: State-aware functionality and persistence leveraging established patterns

## Existing Foundation Integration

### Systems to Leverage (DO NOT REBUILD)
- **GameStateManager**: Extend existing autoload (`target/autoload/game_state_manager.gd`) with additional game flow states
- **SaveGameManager**: Use existing autoload (`target/autoload/SaveGameManager.gd`) - already provides comprehensive save/load
- **PlayerProfile**: Use existing resource (`addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/player/player_profile.gd`) - already comprehensive
- **PilotStatistics**: Use existing resource (`addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/player/pilot_statistics.gd`) - full statistics tracking
- **CampaignState**: Use existing resource (`addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/save_system/campaign_state.gd`) - complete campaign tracking
- **ConfigurationManager**: Use existing autoload (`target/autoload/configuration_manager.gd`) for game flow preferences
- **SaveSlotInfo**: Use existing resource (`addons/wcs_asset_core/resources/save_system/save_slot_info.gd`) for save metadata

### Key Integration Pattern
All EPIC-007 stories extend existing systems rather than creating new ones, following established patterns for autoloads, resource-based data management, signal-driven communication, and validation frameworks.
