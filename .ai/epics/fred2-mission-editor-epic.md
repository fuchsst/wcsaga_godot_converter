# Epic: FRED2 Mission Editor Conversion

**Epic ID**: EPIC-002  
**Epic Title**: WCS-Godot Mission Editor (FRED2 Conversion)  
**Priority**: Critical (Content Creation Tool)  
**Story Manager**: SallySM  
**Epic Status**: Ready for Implementation  

## Epic Overview

**Epic Goal**: Convert the legacy FRED2 mission editor to a modern, cross-platform Godot-native tool that preserves all functionality while providing superior user experience and workflow integration.

**Business Value**: Enables content creators to build missions using modern tools while maintaining compatibility with existing .fs2 mission files and workflows.

**Epic Success Criteria**:
- All existing .fs2 mission files load and display correctly
- Mission editing workflow is 50% faster than original FRED2
- Cross-platform functionality (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Visual SEXP editor replaces text-based tree editing
- Real-time validation prevents common mission errors
- Seamless integration with Godot's 3D editor interface

## Architecture Foundation

**PRD Reference**: `.ai/docs/fred2-mission-editor-prd.md`  
**Analysis Reference**: `.ai/docs/fred2-mission-editor-analysis.md`

**Key Components**:
- MissionData Resource System - Type-safe mission data management
- VisualSexpEditor - Node-based visual scripting interface
- MissionViewport3D - Integrated 3D object manipulation
- FS2ImportExport - Legacy file format compatibility
- ValidationSystem - Real-time error checking and warnings

## Epic Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Components (8 weeks)
**Focus**: Core data model, basic UI, file I/O

1. **Mission Data Resource System** - Core mission data structures
2. **FS2 File Import/Export** - Legacy format compatibility

4. **Mission Object Management** - Create, edit, delete mission objects

### Phase 2: Essential Editing Tools (10 weeks)
**Focus**: Visual editing, SEXP system, properties

5. **Visual SEXP Editor Foundation** - Node-based scripting interface
6. **Object Property Inspector** - Comprehensive object configuration
7. **Basic Asset Integration** - Ship and weapon class support
8. **Real-time Mission Validation** - Error checking and warnings

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (8 weeks)
**Focus**: Complete feature parity, professional workflow

9. **Complete SEXP Operator Set** - All 1000+ operators implemented
10. **Briefing Editor** - Mission briefing creation and editing
11. **Campaign Integration** - Multi-mission campaign support
12. **Performance Optimization** - Large mission handling

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies**:
- WCS Asset Pipeline (EPIC-003) - Required for Phase 2 asset integration
- Ship/Weapon data structures - Basic definitions needed for Phase 1

**Internal Dependencies**:
- Data Migration Foundation (EPIC-001) - ✅ COMPLETED
- Configuration Management - ✅ Available from EPIC-001

**Blocking For**: All mission creation and content development workflows

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics**:
- 100% of existing .fs2 missions load successfully
- Mission editing operations complete in <100ms
- 3D viewport maintains 60 FPS with 100+ objects
- File export maintains perfect .fs2 compatibility
- Cross-platform feature parity achieved

**User Experience Metrics**:
- Mission creation workflow 50% faster than FRED2
- New user productivity within 30 minutes
- 90% user satisfaction in post-implementation surveys
- Zero data loss in mission file operations

**Quality Metrics**:
- Unit test coverage >90% for all core components
- Integration tests validate complete editing workflows
- Real-time validation catches 95% of common mission errors
- Performance benchmarks met for large missions (500+ objects)

## Risk Assessment

**High Risks**:
- SEXP system complexity (1000+ operators) may impact development timeline
- Performance with very large missions may require optimization
- Asset pipeline dependencies could delay Phase 2 features

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Incremental SEXP operator implementation (most common first)
- Early performance profiling and optimization
- Placeholder asset system for Phase 1 development

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Load and display existing .fs2 mission files
- [ ] Basic object placement and manipulation in 3D viewport
- [ ] Export missions back to .fs2 format without data loss
- [ ] Mission objects configurable through property interface

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
