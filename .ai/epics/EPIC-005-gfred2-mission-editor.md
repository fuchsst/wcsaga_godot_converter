**Review Triggered By**: Comprehensive feedback analysis identifying architectural violations in current implementation  
**Story Manager**: SallySM  
**Review Date**: May 31, 2025

### Issues Identified & Resolved
1. **VIOLATION**: Current implementation uses hybrid UI approaches (programmatic + scene-based)
2. **VIOLATION**: No centralized scene structure as mandated by May 30th architecture
3. **VIOLATION**: `dialog_manager.gd` uses programmatic UI construction violating Godot best practices
4. **VIOLATION**: Mixed UI approaches across 5+ folders creating technical debt

### Stories Refined for Architectural Compliance
- **GFRED2-006A**: Enhanced with mandatory scene-based validation components
- **GFRED2-006B**: Refined with centralized scene structure requirements
- **GFRED2-006C**: Updated to eliminate mixed UI approaches
- **GFRED2-006D**: Enhanced with scene-based architecture mandates
- **GFRED2-007**: Refined with briefing editor scene requirements
- **GFRED2-011**: CRITICALLY enhanced with specific violation corrections

### Architectural Requirements Enforced
1. **100% Scene-Based UI**: NO programmatic UI construction allowed
2. **Centralized Structure**: ALL UI in `addons/gfred2/scenes/` exclusively
3. **Performance Standards**: < 16ms scene instantiation, 60+ FPS UI updates
4. **Folder Elimination**: DEPRECATE `ui/`, `dialogs/`, `viewport/ui/` folders
5. **Clear Migration Strategy**: Specific steps to correct architectural violations

### Implementation Impact
- **BEFORE**: Architectural chaos with mixed approaches
- **AFTER**: Definitive scene-based architecture with clear compliance requirements
- **RESULT**: Stories now provide specific guidance to eliminate architectural violations

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR**: Implementation of GFRED2-011 (UI refactoring) is now **MANDATORY** to resolve architectural violations before proceeding with other stories.
