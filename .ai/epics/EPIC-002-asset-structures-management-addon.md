# EPIC-002: Asset Structures and Management Addon

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: EPIC-002  
**Epic Name**: Asset Structures and Management Addon  
**Epic Owner**: Larry (WCS Analyst)  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Implementation Delivered  
**Created**: 2025-01-26  

## Epic Description
Extract existing asset management data structures from the main game into a shared addon that provides data definitions, folder organization, and resource loading capabilities for both the main game and FRED2 editor. This addon will serve as the foundation for all asset-related operations while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

**Source Code Analysis Insights**: Analysis of 21 primary WCS asset files (~50,000+ lines) reveals complex interdependencies, particularly circular references between ship and weapon systems. However, Godot's Resource system and component architecture can elegantly handle these relationships while maintaining clean separation.

## Scope Definition

### In Scope (Addon Responsibility)
- **Data Structures**: Asset class definitions (ShipData, WeaponData, ArmorData, etc.)
- **Folder Organization**: Standardized asset directory structure and naming conventions
- **Resource Definitions**: `.tres` file templates and GDScript resource classes
- **Asset Loading**: Core loading mechanisms and resource instantiation
- **Asset Registry**: Central catalog of available assets with metadata
- **Asset Querying**: Search and filtering capabilities for asset discovery
- **Asset Validation**: Basic integrity checks for loaded resources

### Out of Scope (Main Game Responsibility)
- **Lifecycle Management**: Creation, destruction, and state management of game objects
- **Runtime Systems**: Ship movement, weapon firing, damage handling
- **Game Logic**: Combat mechanics, AI behavior, mission systems
- **Performance Management**: Object pooling, memory optimization
- **Data Migration**: Conversion from WCS formats (handled in data-migration-epic)

## Analysis Summary
Based on analysis of existing implementations in `/target/scripts/resources/ship_weapon/`:

### Existing Asset Structures (To Extract)
1. **ShipData.gd** - 100+ properties covering ship specifications
2. **WeaponData.gd** - Complete weapon definitions with physics/rendering
3. **ArmorData.gd** - Armor and shielding specifications
4. **AssetManager.gd** - Central loading and caching system
5. **Supporting utilities** - Validation, conversion, and helper functions

### Current Architecture Issues
- Asset structures duplicated between editor and game
- Tight coupling between data definitions and game logic
- No standardized asset discovery mechanism
- Manual resource path management

## Epic Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Centralized Asset Definitions**: Single source of truth for all asset data structures
2. **Shared Codebase**: Eliminate duplication between game and editor
3. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between data and behavior
4. **Extensibility**: Framework for adding new asset types
5. **Developer Experience**: Simplified asset access and management

### Success Metrics
- Zero code duplication for asset definitions
- 100% asset discoverability through registry
- Editor and game use identical asset loading
- Clean addon interface with minimal dependencies
- Complete test coverage for asset operations

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points
- **Main Game**: Imports addon for asset access during runtime
- **FRED2 Editor**: Uses addon for asset browsing and editing
- **Asset Pipeline**: Foundation for data migration tools
- **Testing Framework**: Shared test utilities for asset validation

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies
- Core Godot Resource system
- FileSystem access capabilities
- JSON/Binary serialization support

### Downstream Dependencies
- Main game asset loading (will be refactored)
- FRED2 asset browser (EPIC-005)
- Data migration tools (EPIC-003)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks (Based on source analysis)
1. **Circular Ship-Weapon Dependencies**: WCS has ship.h â†” weapon.h circular references
   - *Mitigation*: Use Godot Resource references instead of direct includes, break cycles with indices
2. **Complex Asset Relationships**: 21 files with intricate dependencies (~50,000+ lines)
   - *Mitigation*: Leverage Godot's Resource system to handle relationships automatically
3. **Asset Loading Performance**: 4,750-slot texture cache and model caching in WCS
   - *Mitigation*: Not a concern - Godot handles caching efficiently for 15+ year old assets

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Adding game logic to addon
   - *Mitigation*: Clear scope boundaries and regular reviews
2. **Timeline Impact**: Large refactoring effort
   - *Mitigation*: Incremental delivery with MVP approach
