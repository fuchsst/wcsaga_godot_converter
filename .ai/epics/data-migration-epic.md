# Epic: WCS Data Migration Foundation

**Epic ID**: EPIC-001  
**Epic Title**: WCS Data Migration Foundation Layer  
**Priority**: Critical (Blocking)  
**Story Manager**: SallySM  
**Epic Status**: Completed  

## Epic Overview

**Epic Goal**: Create a comprehensive data migration system that converts all WCS player data, save games, configuration, and assets to Godot-native formats while preserving complete functionality and enabling enhanced features.

**Business Value**: Enables seamless transition from WCS to Godot implementation, preserving years of player progression and ensuring zero data loss during conversion.

**Epic Success Criteria**:
- All existing WCS .PLR files can be migrated without data loss
- All campaign save states (.CSG) are preserved with complete progression
- Configuration settings are converted and enhanced with Godot capabilities
- Asset references are updated and validated in new system
- Migration process is robust, validated, and error-resistant

## Architecture Foundation

**Architecture Reference**: `.ai/docs/wcs-data-architecture.md`  
**Analysis Reference**: `.ai/docs/wcs-data-migration-analysis.md`

**Key Components**:
- DataManager (Autoload) - Central data management system
- PlayerProfile Resource - Type-safe player data structure
- CampaignState Resource - Campaign progression tracking
- ConfigurationManager - Settings and preferences management
- MigrationManager - Legacy data conversion system

## Epic Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Components (Critical Path)
1. **PlayerProfile Resource** - Core player data structure
2. **ConfigurationManager** - Settings and preferences system
3. **SaveGameManager** - Save/load operations

### Phase 2: Migration Pipeline
4. **PLR Migration System** - Convert WCS player files
5. **Configuration Migration** - Convert settings and controls  
6. **Campaign State Migration** - Convert save game data

### Phase 3: Asset Integration
7. **Asset Registry** - Asset management and validation
8. **Asset Path Migration** - Update asset references

## User Stories

### Story Mapping

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies**: None (Foundation epic)  
**Internal Dependencies**: Must complete Foundation before Migration, Asset Integration requires both Foundation and Migration

**Blocking For**: All other conversion epics depend on this data foundation

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics**:
- 100% of existing .PLR files successfully migrated
- 100% of campaign progression preserved
- All configuration settings converted
- Save/load operations < 500ms performance target
- Zero data corruption during migration

**Quality Metrics**:
- All acceptance criteria met across all stories
- Unit test coverage > 90% for all migration components
- Integration tests validate end-to-end migration flows
- Error handling covers all edge cases and corruption scenarios

## Risk Assessment

**High Risks**:
- WCS file format corruption causing migration failures
- Version incompatibility between different WCS save formats
- Performance issues with large save file migrations

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive validation and error recovery
- Multiple format version support with fallback handling
- Streaming and batched processing for large datasets
- Complete backup system before migration attempts

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All user stories completed and validated
- [x] End-to-end migration tested with real WCS data
- [x] Performance targets met for all data operations
- [x] Error handling verified with corrupted/edge case data
- [x] Migration process documented and validated
- [x] Quality gates passed for all components

**Epic Definition of Done**: All stories complete, migration validated with real WCS data, performance targets achieved, comprehensive error handling verified, and quality gates passed.
