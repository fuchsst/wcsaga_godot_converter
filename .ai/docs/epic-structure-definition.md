- [ ] Architecture review and approval completed

### Integration Testing Requirements
- Cross-epic integration testing at phase boundaries
- Performance validation for graphics and gameplay systems
- Memory usage optimization and validation
- Platform compatibility testing (Windows, Linux)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **High Complexity Epics**: Break into smaller stories, prototype early
- **Critical Path Items**: Prioritize resources, parallel development where possible
- **Integration Risks**: Early integration testing, clear interface definitions
