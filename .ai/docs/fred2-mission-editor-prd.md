## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Create a modern, cross-platform mission editor for WCS-Godot that preserves all FRED2 functionality while leveraging Godot's advanced editor capabilities, providing content creators with a superior mission development experience.

### Strategic Objectives
- **Preserve Legacy**: 100% compatibility with existing .fs2 mission files

- **Contingency**: Focus on 80% most-used operators for initial release

**2. Performance with Large Missions (Medium Impact, Medium Probability)**
- **Risk**: Godot performance may not match optimized C++ FRED2 for very large missions
- **Mitigation**: Profiling-driven optimization, Level-of-Detail systems
- **Contingency**: Performance warnings and mission complexity limits

**3. Asset Pipeline Dependencies (High Impact, Low Probability)**
- **Risk**: Mission editor needs asset pipeline (EPIC-003) for full functionality
- **Mitigation**: Placeholder asset system for initial development
- **Contingency**: Basic asset support sufficient for core functionality

### Medium-Risk Areas

**4. File Format Compatibility (Medium Impact, Low Probability)**
- **Risk**: Edge cases in .fs2 format may cause compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with real mission files, fuzzing
- **Contingency**: Manual migration tools for problematic missions

**5. User Adoption (Low Impact, Medium Probability)**
- **Risk**: Users may resist change from familiar FRED2 interface
- **Mitigation**: User testing, familiar keyboard shortcuts, migration guides
- **Contingency**: FRED2 compatibility mode with traditional interface
