# Product Requirements Document: WCS SEXP Expression System Conversion

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 25, 2025  
**Author**: Curly (Conversion Manager)  
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
Convert Wing Commander Saga's SEXP (S-Expression) mission scripting system to a GDScript-based runtime that maintains full compatibility with existing WCS missions. SEXP is the mission scripting backbone with 444 operators controlling objectives, AI behavior, triggers, and campaign logic. This system must preserve 100% mission compatibility while leveraging Godot's event-driven architecture.

### Success Criteria
- [x] **Complete Compatibility**: 100% of WCS mission SEXP scripts execute correctly
- [x] **Performance Parity**: Equal or better performance than original C++ implementation
- [x] **Integration Excellence**: Seamless integration with all Godot game systems
- [x] **Developer Experience**: Visual SEXP editor and debugging tools in Godot
- [x] **Extensibility**: Framework for adding new operators and mission scripting features

## System Analysis Summary

### Original WCS System
- **Purpose**: Complete mission scripting language with 444 operators across 10 categories
- **Key Features**: 
  - S-Expression syntax with dynamic tree evaluation
  - 52 different argument types with type checking
  - Variable persistence across missions and campaigns
  - Real-time event triggers and conditional logic
  - Visual editor integration (FRED2)
- **Performance Characteristics**: Dynamic evaluation, cached results, lazy evaluation patterns
- **Dependencies**: All game systems (ships, weapons, AI, objectives, variables)

### Conversion Scope
- **In Scope**: Complete SEXP interpreter, all 444 operators, variable system, debugging tools
- **Out of Scope**: FRED2 editor (handled by EPIC-005)
- **Modified Features**: Adapt to Godot's signal-based architecture while preserving SEXP logic
- **New Features**: Visual debugging, GDScript extension API, performance profiling
