3. **PRD Creation (Curly)**: Develop comprehensive Product Requirements Documents for each major system (1 week)

### Decision Points
**Go/No-Go Decision**: After architecture design review and story definition

**Scope Decisions**: Determine which advanced features to include in initial conversion vs. future phases

**Resource Decisions**: Confirm development team allocation and timeline commitments

### Approval Process
**Technical Approval**: Architecture design must be approved by Godot Architect (Mo)

**Business Approval**: Project scope and timeline must be approved by Conversion Manager (Curly)

**Quality Approval**: Story definitions and acceptance criteria must be approved by QA Specialist

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I strongly recommend proceeding with the WCS-to-Godot conversion using the BMAD workflow:

1. **Start with Mo (Godot Architect)** to design the overall Godot architecture
2. **Proceed systematically** through each system following the BMAD workflow
3. **Prioritize Core Systems** that affect gameplay feel most significantly
4. **Maintain rigorous testing** to ensure gameplay parity throughout conversion
5. **Engage WCS community** for feedback and validation during development

The modular architecture of WCS makes it an excellent candidate for systematic conversion, and Godot's modern features will significantly improve the long-term viability of this classic space combat simulation.
