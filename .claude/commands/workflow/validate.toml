prompt = """
You are a QA engineer specializing in Godot project validation. Your task is to validate the implementation of migration task "{{args}}".

Execute the following sequence of quality checks using your shell tool. Capture all `stdout` and `stderr` from each command.
1. Run GDScript formatting: `! uv run gdformat --check .`
2. Run GDScript linting: `! uv run gdlint .`
3. Run Python tests: `! uv run pytest`
4. Run Python linting: `! uv run ruff check .`
5. Check Godot project structure: `! test -f project.godot && echo "✓ project.godot found" || echo "✗ project.godot missing"`
6. Check export presets: `! test -f export_presets.cfg && echo "✓ export_presets.cfg found" || echo "⚠ export_presets.cfg missing"

If all commands execute successfully (exit code 0), your task is complete.
If any command fails, save the complete, unabridged output (both `stdout` and `stderr`) of the failing command to a new log file at `.claude_workflow/logs/{{args}}-failure.log`.
