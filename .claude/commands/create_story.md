Guide the creation of user stories for a WCS-Godot conversion epic.

You are initiating story creation for the epic: $ARGUMENTS

## Story Creation Process

### 1. Load BMAD Framework
- Load the Story Manager persona (SallySM) from `.bmad/personas/story-manager.md`
- Reference the story creation task from `.bmad/tasks/create-wcs-story.md`
- Use the story template from `.bmad/templates/wcs-story-template.md`

### 2. Prerequisites Check (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)
Before creating ANY stories, verify:
- [ ] PRD exists and is approved in `.ai/docs/[system-name]-prd.md`
- [ ] Architecture document exists and is approved in `.ai/docs/[system-name]-architecture.md`
- [ ] Epic definition and scope are established
- [ ] Only ONE epic is currently in progress (BMAD Rule #3)

**VIOLATION CHECK**: If any prerequisite is missing, STOP and complete required phase first.

### 3. Story Creation Steps
Follow SallySM's systematic approach:

Before we begin, make sure that we have an epic defined, where the story is associated. Use a appropriate prefix for the story (e.g. SHIP-001-story-title for the first story of the "EPIC-012 Ship Scene and Script implementation")

1. **Story Definition**
   - Title: Clear, descriptive title explaining the story's purpose
   - User Perspective: Define who benefits from this functionality
   - Functionality: Specific capability or feature being implemented
   - Business Value: Why this story matters for the conversion

2. **Acceptance Criteria Definition**
   - Specific: Each criterion must be precise and unambiguous
   - Testable: All criteria must be objectively verifiable
   - Measurable: Include concrete metrics where applicable
   - Complete: Cover all aspects of the required functionality

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - Architecture Reference: Link to relevant architecture components
   - Implementation Guidance: Specific technical approach and patterns
   - Performance Criteria: Frame rate, memory, and efficiency requirements
   - Integration Points: How this story connects with other systems

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Prerequisites: Stories that must be completed first
   - Blockers: External dependencies that could delay implementation
   - Related Stories: Other stories that interact with this one
   - Impact Analysis: How this story affects other planned work

### 4. Story Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Small Stories**: 1-3 days of development work maximum
- **Single Responsibility**: Each story should have one clear purpose
- **Independent**: Minimal dependencies on incomplete work
- **Valuable**: Delivers meaningful progress toward conversion goals
- **Testable**: All acceptance criteria can be objectively verified

### 5. Quality Validation Checklist
Run the story draft checklist:
- [ ] Story follows proper template structure
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Technical requirements reference approved architecture
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and documented
- [ ] Story size is appropriate (1-3 days maximum)
- [ ] Definition of Done is complete and realistic
- [ ] WCS reference material is identified
- [ ] Godot implementation approach is specified

### 6. Output Requirements
Create well-defined user stories:
- **Location**: `.ai/stories/[story-name].md`
- **Template**: Use `.bmad/templates/wcs-story-template.md`
- **Content**: Complete story with all required elements
- **Approval**: Stories must be approved before implementation

## Critical Workflow Enforcement (SallySM's Rules)
- "Before we create this story, let me verify the architecture is approved..."
- "This violates BMAD Rule #3 - only one epic can be in progress at a time."
- "The acceptance criteria need to be more specific and testable."
- "Let's run the story readiness checklist before proceeding."
- "This story has dependencies that must be completed first."

## BMAD Workflow Compliance
- **Prerequisites**: PRD and Architecture must be approved
- **Approval Required**: Story must be approved before implementation
- **Quality Gates**: All checklist items must be satisfied
- **Documentation**: Store completed story in `.ai/stories/` directory
- **Next Phase**: Implementation cannot begin without approved story
- **Single Epic Rule**: Ensure only one epic is in progress at a time

## Technical Story Requirements for WCS-Godot
- **WCS Reference**: Link to original C++ code or system analysis
- **Godot Implementation**: Specific Godot nodes, scenes, and patterns to use
- **Performance Criteria**: Frame rate, memory, and efficiency requirements
- **Integration Points**: How the story connects with other converted systems
- **Static Typing**: All GDScript code must use static typing
- **Testing**: Unit tests using GUT framework required
