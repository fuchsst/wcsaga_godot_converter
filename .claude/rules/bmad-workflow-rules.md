## Automatic Responses to Violations

### Minor Violations
**Response**: 
```
‚ùå BMAD WORKFLOW VIOLATION DETECTED

üõë CRITICAL BMAD WORKFLOW VIOLATION
Issue: [Specific violation]
Impact: [Workflow integrity compromised]
Required Action: Return to [specific phase] and complete all requirements
All work STOPPED until compliance restored.
```

### Critical Violations
**Response**:
```
üö® SEVERE BMAD WORKFLOW VIOLATION
Issue: [Specific violation]
Impact: Project quality standards compromised
Required Action: Full workflow review and corrective measures
Development HALTED until explicit approval to resume.
```

## Persona-Specific Enforcement

### Larry (WCS Analyst)
- MUST reference specific files in `source/` submodule
- MUST create analysis documents in `.ai/docs/`
- MUST use `.bmad/templates/wcs-conversion-brief-template.md`

### Curly (Conversion Manager)
- MUST use `.bmad/templates/conversion-prd-template.md`
- MUST run `.bmad/checklists/conversion-prd-quality-checklist.md`
- MUST ensure single epic focus

### Mo (Godot Architect)
- MUST use `.bmad/templates/godot-architecture-template.md`
- MUST run `.bmad/checklists/godot-architecture-checklist.md`
- MUST enforce Godot-native design patterns

### SallySM (Story Manager)
- MUST use `.bmad/templates/wcs-story-template.md`
- MUST run `.bmad/checklists/story-readiness-checklist.md`
- MUST enforce workflow compliance

### Dev (GDScript Developer)
- MUST enforce 100% static typing
- MUST create `CLAUDE.md` for code packages
- MUST run `.bmad/checklists/story-definition-of-done-checklist.md`

### QA (Quality Assurance)
- MUST validate all quality checklists
- MUST verify feature parity with WCS
- MUST approve only compliant implementations

## Enforcement Commands

### Workflow Validation
```
/bmad:check_workflow - Validate current workflow state
/bmad:validate_phase [phase] - Check specific phase compliance
/bmad:run_checklist [checklist] - Execute quality gate
```

### Violation Reporting
```
/bmad:report_violation [type] [description] - Document violation
/bmad:escalate_violation [violation_id] - Escalate to project leadership
```

### Compliance Restoration
```
/bmad:restore_compliance [phase] - Return to compliant state
/bmad:approve_override [justification] - Request violation override (rare)
```

## Override Conditions (EXTREMELY RARE)

### Emergency Override
Only allowed for:
- Critical production issues
- External dependency failures
- Force majeure circumstances

### Override Process
1. Document emergency justification
2. Escalate to project leadership
3. Implement temporary workaround
4. Schedule compliance restoration
5. Conduct post-incident review

## Continuous Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Phase progression validation
- Template compliance verification
- Quality gate completion tracking
- Git commit verification
- Code quality standards enforcement

### Violation Tracking
- All violations logged with timestamps
- Violation patterns analyzed for process improvement
- Repeat violations escalated automatically
- Compliance metrics reported regularly

---

**REMEMBER**: These rules are not suggestions - they are mandatory requirements that ensure project success. BMAD workflow violations lead to technical debt, rework, and project failure. No exceptions without explicit override approval.

**CLAUDE DIRECTIVE**: Always check these rules before proceeding with any BMAD workflow action. When in doubt, STOP and verify compliance.
