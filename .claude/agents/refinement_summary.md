# Agent Refinement Summary

This document summarizes the refinements made to the AI agents in the `.claude/agents/` directory to align them with the Multi-Agent Framework and Godot Project Structure concepts, while ensuring they use the appropriate tools from the Development Toolchain.

## Overview

All six agents have been updated to explicitly reference and integrate with the development toolchain described in `concepts/Development_Toolchain.md`. The refinements focus on:

1. Adding Development Toolchain Integration sections to each agent
2. Ensuring agents reference appropriate tools like `grep`, `run_shell_command`, `pytest`, `uv`, `gdformat`, `gdlint`, and `gdUnit4`
3. Aligning agents with the Godot project structure principles
4. Maintaining consistency with the multi-agent workflow

## Refined Agents

### 1. Migration Architect
- Added Development Toolchain Integration section
- Specified use of `grep`, `run_shell_command`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `write_file`
- Maintained focus on data-centric architecture and system mapping

### 2. C++ Code Analyst
- Added Development Toolchain Integration section
- Emphasized use of `grep`, `run_shell_command`, `search_file_content`, `read_file`, `write_file`
- Specified requirement for Python-based analysis tools to be tested with `pytest` and managed with `uv`

### 3. Godot Systems Designer
- Added Development Toolchain Integration section
- Referenced `search_file_content`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command`
- Specified that GDScript implementations should follow Godot best practices and be validated with `gdlint` and `gdformat`

### 4. GDScript Engineer
- Added Development Toolchain Integration section
- Detailed use of `write_file`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`
- Specified that GDScript code should be validated with `gdformat` and `gdlint`
- Mentioned creation of unit tests using `gdUnit4`
- Referenced Python tooling validation with `pytest` and dependency management with `uv`

### 5. Asset Pipeline Engineer
- Added Development Toolchain Integration section
- Specified use of `glob`, `search_file_content`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command`
- Referenced Python-based conversion tools managed with `uv` and tested with `pytest`
- Mentioned GDScript validation with `gdlint` and `gdformat`
- Included use of `grep` for asset pattern validation

### 6. Lead Developer
- Added Development Toolchain Integration section
- Comprehensive reference to all tools: `gdlint`, `gdformat`, `uv`, `pytest`, `gdUnit4`, Godot headless mode, `ruff`, `grep`
- Emphasized importance of CI/CD pipeline integration

## Key Improvements

1. **Toolchain Awareness**: All agents now explicitly mention which tools from the development toolchain they should utilize
2. **Quality Assurance**: Clear references to code quality tools like `gdlint`, `gdformat`, `ruff`, and testing frameworks
3. **Python Tooling**: Proper integration of Python-based tools with `uv` for dependency management and `pytest` for testing
4. **Automation**: References to Godot headless mode for automated processes
5. **Validation**: Use of `grep` for codebase consistency checks
6. **Consistency**: All agents follow the same pattern of including a Development Toolchain Integration section

## Integration with Multi-Agent Framework

The refined agents maintain their roles in the multi-agent workflow:
1. Migration Architect creates the strategic plan
2. C++ Code Analyst performs deep code analysis
3. Godot Systems Designer creates the target architecture
4. GDScript Engineer implements the code and tests
5. Asset Pipeline Engineer handles asset conversion
6. Lead Developer provides oversight and validation

Each agent now better understands how to leverage the development toolchain to accomplish their responsibilities while maintaining code quality and consistency throughout the migration process.
