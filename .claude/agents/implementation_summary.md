# Wing Commander Saga to Godot - Multi-Agent Framework Implementation

This document confirms the successful implementation of the multi-agent framework for converting Wing Commander Saga from its original C++ FreeSpace Open engine to the Godot engine. All five core agents have been created and are ready for use in the conversion process.

## Implemented Agents

### 1. Migration Architect
**File**: `.claude/agents/migration_architect.md`
**Role**: Strategic Planning & Data Architecture
**Responsibilities**:
- Holistic high-level analysis of the C++ source code
- Data-centric architecture plan using Godot's Resource system
- System mapping from C++ to Godot equivalents
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Task breakdown for other agents

### 2. C++ Code Analyst
**File**: `.claude/agents/cpp_code_analyst.md`
**Role**: Source Code Analysis & Translation Specification
**Responsibilities**:
- Deep structural static analysis of C++ codebase
- Dependency graph generation and visualization
- Engine-specific coupling identification
- Prioritized GDScript translation specification
- Verification plan for translated code

### 3. Godot Systems Designer
**File**: `.claude/agents/godot_systems_designer.md`
**Role**: Target Architecture Design
**Responsibilities**:
- Scene and node hierarchy design for Godot
- Logic distribution strategy using signals
- Custom resource specification (critical task)
- Data flow diagram creation
- Idiomatic Godot architecture design

### 4. GDScript Engineer
**File**: `.claude/agents/gdscript_engineer.md`
**Role**: GDScript Implementation & Testing
**Responsibilities**:
- Implementation of custom resource scripts
- GDScript game logic implementation
- Unit test suite creation with gdUnit4
- Integration guide provision
- Code quality and performance optimization

### 5. Asset Pipeline Engineer
**File**: `.claude/agents/asset_pipeline_engineer.md`
**Role**: Asset Conversion & Integration
**Responsibilities**:
- Audit and catalog all source assets
- Design conversion and import pipeline
- Develop shader porting strategy
- Automate pipeline via EditorImportPlugin
- Ensure non-destructive workflow for artists

## Agent Orchestration Workflow

The agents work together in a structured workflow following the prompt chaining methodology:

1. **Migration Architect** creates the master strategy for a data-driven rewrite
2. Its output feeds to both **C++ Code Analyst** and **Godot Systems Designer**
3. **C++ Code Analyst** produces detailed translation specification for GDScript rewrite
4. **Godot Systems Designer** creates Godot-native architecture and custom resources
5. **GDScript Engineer** and **Asset Pipeline Engineer** work in parallel to implement:
   - Game logic in GDScript with unit tests
   - Asset conversion and integration pipeline

## Integration with Existing Lead Developer Agent

The newly created agents complement the existing **Lead Developer** agent:
**File**: `.claude/agents/lead_developer.md`
**Role**: Senior game development lead specializing in space simulation games

The Lead Developer agent provides oversight and can be used for:
- Architectural planning and technical reviews
- Complex implementation guidance in C++ and Godot
- Code quality and architectural decision validation
- Performance optimization for space combat simulations

## Directory Structure Implementation

All agents are organized according to the Godot project's hybrid organizational model:

```
.claude/
└── agents/
    ├── lead_developer.md          # Existing lead developer agent
    ├── migration_architect.md     # Strategic planning agent
    ├── cpp_code_analyst.md        # Deep code analysis agent
    ├── godot_systems_designer.md  # Target architecture designer
    ├── gdscript_engineer.md       # Implementation and testing agent
    └── asset_pipeline_engineer.md # Asset conversion agent
```

## Usage Instructions

To use these agents effectively:

1. **Sequential Workflow**: Execute agents in the prescribed order for maximum effectiveness
2. **Prompt Chaining**: Use output from one agent as input to the next
3. **Human Oversight**: Apply expert human review at critical decision points
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Feed findings back to refine earlier agent outputs
5. **Validation**: Verify each agent's output before proceeding to the next

## Next Steps

With all five agents implemented, the conversion framework is complete and ready for use. The next steps involve:

1. **Agent Testing**: Validate each agent's functionality with sample inputs
2. **Workflow Execution**: Begin the conversion process following the orchestrated workflow
3. **Implementation**: Use agent outputs to guide actual code and asset conversion
4. **Iteration**: Refine and improve the process based on real-world results
5. **Completion**: Finalize the full conversion of Wing Commander Saga to Godot

This multi-agent framework provides a robust, structured approach to the complex task of engine migration while preserving the core gameplay functionality and extending it with modern engine capabilities.
