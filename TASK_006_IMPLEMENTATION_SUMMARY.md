# Task-006 Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

I successfully implemented task-006: "Implement ShipClassGenerator and Godot .tres file generation" as specified in the STORY-001 breakdown. The implementation includes:

### 1. Feature-based Directory Structure
- Updated the ShipClassGenerator to follow the required feature-based organization structure:
  - `/features/fighters/{faction}/{ship_name}/{ship_name}.tres` for fighters and bombers
  - `/features/capital_ships/{faction}/{ship_name}/{ship_name}.tres` for capital ships
- Implemented proper ship category determination based on ship names and types

### 2. Complete Ship Data Generation
- Enhanced the .tres file generation to include comprehensive ship data:
  - Physics properties (mass, density, power output, velocity, acceleration)
  - Rotation properties (pitch, bank, heading times)
  - Weapon energy and regeneration rates
  - Hull and shield strengths
  - Afterburner fuel capacity

### 3. Weapon Bank Configuration Support
- Added support for weapon bank configurations in generated resources:
  - Allowed primary and secondary weapon banks
  - Default weapon bank allocations
  - Secondary bank capacities
  - Dogfight mode weapon bank configurations
- Implemented proper formatting methods for weapon banks and integer lists

### 4. Asset Reference Mapping
- Enhanced asset reference mapping with complete paths for all asset types:
  - 3D models (POF files, cockpit models, target files)
  - UI assets (ship icons, overhead views, tech database assets)
  - Audio assets (engine sounds, alive/dead sounds, warp sounds)
  - Visual effects (thruster flames, glows, explosions)
  - Animation assets (warp animations, tech animations)

### 5. Unit Tests
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the ShipClassGenerator
- Implemented integration tests to verify the end-to-end conversion process
- All tests are passing, demonstrating the correctness of the implementation

## Key Changes Made

### ShipClassGenerator Enhancements
- Modified directory structure to follow feature-based organization
- Added `_determine_ship_category` method for proper ship classification
- Enhanced `_create_ship_resource_content` with complete ship data
- Added `_format_weapon_banks` and `_format_integer_list` methods
- Updated `_generate_ship_registry` to use the new structure

### Test Coverage
- Created `test_ship_class_generator.py` with 10 unit tests
- Created `test_ship_conversion_integration.py` for integration testing
- All tests pass, ensuring the implementation works correctly

## Validation
- Unit tests verify all functionality works as expected
- Integration tests confirm the ShipTableConverter and ShipClassGenerator work together
- Generated .tres files follow Godot resource format specifications
- Directory structure matches the required feature-based organization

The implementation successfully fulfills all requirements specified in task-006 and STORY-001.
