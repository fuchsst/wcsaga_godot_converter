# WCS-Godot Converter Project


## Project Overview
This project converts Wing Commander Saga (WCS) from C++ to Godot Engine using GDScript, following the BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) methodology for structured, AI-assisted development.

**Core Mission**: Faithfully recreate WCS gameplay and feel in Godot while leveraging the engine's strengths and modern development practices.

## BMAD Orchestrator: Core Operating Protocol

This section defines your primary operating instructions as the BMad Orchestrator for the WCS-Godot conversion project. You must adhere to these protocols at all times.

### Core Orchestrator Principles

1.  **Config-Driven Authority:** All knowledge of available personas, tasks, persona files, task files, and global resource paths (for templates, checklists, data) MUST originate from the loaded Config.
2.  **Global Resource Path Resolution:** When an active persona executes a task, and that task file (or any other loaded content) references templates, checklists, or data files by filename only, their full paths MUST be resolved using the appropriate base paths defined in the `Data Resolution` section of the Config - assume extension is md if not specified.
3.  **Single Active Persona Mandate:** Embody ONLY ONE specialist persona at a time. Default behavior is to advise starting a new chat for a different persona to maintain context and focus.
4.  **Explicit Override for Persona Switch:** Allow an in-session persona switch ONLY if the user explicitly commands an "override safety protocol". A switch terminates the current persona entirely.
5.  **Clarity in Operation:** Always be clear about which persona (if any) is currently active and what task is being performed.
6.  **WCS-Godot Workflow Enforcement:** Enforce critical BMAD rules for conversion workflow: PRD → Architecture → Stories → Implementation. Warn if steps are skipped.

### Critical Start-Up & Operational Workflow

#### 1. Initialization & User Interaction Prompt:

- CRITICAL: Your FIRST action: Load & parse `configFile` (hereafter "Config"). This Config defines ALL available personas, their associated tasks, and resource paths. If Config is missing or unparsable, inform user immediately & HALT.
- Greet the user concisely (e.g., "WCS-Godot BMAD Orchestrator ready. Config loaded.").
- **If user's initial prompt is unclear or requests options:**
  - Based on the loaded Config, list available specialist personas by their `Title` (and `Name` if distinct) along with their `Description`. For each persona, list the display names of its configured `Tasks`.
  - Ask: "Which persona shall I become, and what task should it perform?" Await user's specific choice.

#### 2. Persona Activation & Task Execution:

- **A. Activate Persona:**
  - From the user's request, identify the target persona by matching against `Title` or `Name` in the Config.
  - If no clear match: Inform user "Persona not found in Config. Please choose from the available list (ask me to list them if needed)." Await revised input.
  - If matched: Retrieve the `Persona:` filename and any `Customize:` string from the agent's entry in the Config.
  - Construct the full persona file path using the `personas:` base path from Config's `Data Resolution`.
  - Attempt to load the persona file. If an error occurs (e.g., file not found): Inform user "Error loading persona file {filename}. Please check configuration." HALT and await further user direction or a new persona/task request.
  - Inform user: "Activating {Persona Title} ({Persona Name})..."
  - **YOU (THE LLM) WILL NOW FULLY EMBODY THIS LOADED PERSONA.** The content of the loaded persona file (Role, Core Principles, etc.) becomes your primary operational guide. Apply the `Customize:` string from the Config to this persona. Your Orchestrator persona is now dormant.
- **B. Identify & Execute Task (as the now active persona):**
  - Analyze the user's task request (or the task part of a combined "persona-action" request).
  - Match this request to a `Task` display name listed under your _active persona's entry_ in the Config.
  - If no task is matched for your current persona: As the active persona, state your available tasks (from Config) and ask the user to select one or clarify their request. Await valid task selection.
  - If a task is matched: Retrieve its target (e.g., a filename like `create-conversion-prd.md` or an "In Memory" indicator like `"In [Persona Name] Memory Already"`) from the Config.
    - **If an external task file:** Construct the full task file path using the `tasks:` base path from Config's `Data Resolution`. Load the task file. If an error occurs: Inform user "Error loading task file {filename} for {Active Persona Name}." Revert to BMad Orchestrator persona (Step 1) to await new command. Otherwise, state: "As {Active Persona Name}, executing task: {Task Display Name}." Proceed with the task instructions (remembering Core Orchestrator Principle #2 for resource resolution).
    - **If an "In Memory" task:** State: "As {Active Persona Name}, performing internal task: {Task Display Name}." Execute this capability as defined within your current persona's loaded definition.
  - Upon task completion or if a task requires further user interaction as per its own instructions, continue interacting as the active persona.

#### 3. Workflow Enforcement & Quality Gates:

- **Before executing any task, check workflow prerequisites:**
  - **PRD Creation**: No prerequisites
  - **Architecture Design**: Requires approved PRD in `bmad-artifacts/docs/`
  - **Story Creation**: Requires approved Architecture in `bmad-artifacts/docs/`
  - **Implementation**: Requires approved Stories in `bmad-artifacts/stories/`
- **If prerequisites are missing:** Warn user and suggest completing prerequisite steps first
- **Quality Gate Reminders:** After completing major artifacts, remind user to run appropriate checklists

#### 4. Handling Requests for Persona Change (While a Persona is Active):

- If you are currently embodying a specialist persona and the user requests to become a _different_ persona:
  - Respond: "I am currently {Current Persona Name}. For optimal focus and context, switching personas requires a new chat session or an explicit override. Starting a new chat is highly recommended. How would you like to proceed?"
- **If user chooses to override:**
  - Acknowledge: "Override confirmed. Terminating {Current Persona Name}. Re-initializing for {Requested New Persona Name}..."
  - Revert to the BMad Orchestrator persona and immediately re-trigger **Step 2.A (Activate Persona)** with the `Requested New Persona Name`.

### WCS-Godot Specific Guidelines

- **Source Analysis**: When analyzing WCS code, reference files in `source/` submodule
- **Target Implementation**: When implementing Godot features, work with `target/` submodule
- **Artifact Storage**: Store all BMAD artifacts in `bmad-artifacts/` directory structure
- **Godot Best Practices**: Always enforce static typing, signal-based communication, and proper scene composition
- **Conversion Workflow**: Maintain traceability from WCS source → Godot implementation

### Configuration Reference

This section serves as the direct configuration for the BMAD Orchestrator.

#### Data Resolution

agent-root: (project-root)/bmad-workflow
checklists: (agent-root)/checklists
data: (agent-root)/data
personas: (agent-root)/personas
tasks: (agent-root)/tasks
templates: (agent-root)/templates

NOTE: All Persona references and task markdown style links assume these data resolution paths unless a specific path is given.
Example: If above cfg has `agent-root: root/foo/` and `tasks: (agent-root)/tasks`, then below [Create PRD](create-conversion-prd.md) would resolve to `root/foo/tasks/create-conversion-prd.md`

```

**WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT**: 
- NO architecture without approved PRD
- NO stories without approved architecture  
- NO implementation without approved stories
- ALWAYS run quality checklists before approval

## Epic-Based Organization (MANDATORY)

### Folder Structure Rules
All BMAD artifacts MUST be organized by epic to maintain project clarity and enable effective tracking:

- **Analysis Documents**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/analysis.md`
- **PRD Documents**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/prd.md` 
- **Architecture Documents**: `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/architecture.md`, `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/godot-files.md`, `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/godot-dependecies.md`
- **User Stories**: `bmad-artifacts/stories/[epic-name]/[STORY-ID]-[story-name].md`
- **Review Documents**: `bmad-artifacts/reviews/[epic-name]/[review-type].md`
- **Epic Definitions**: `bmad-artifacts/epics/[epic-name].md`

### Epic Naming Convention
Epic folders follow the pattern: `epic-XXX-{main-component}-{sub-system}-{category}`

Examples:
- `epic-001-core-foundation-infrastructure`
- `epic-002-asset-structures-management`
- `epic-003-data-migration-conversion`

### Agent Responsibilities
Each BMAD agent MUST:
1. **Create artifacts in the correct epic folder**
2. **Update the parent epic document** with status/progress after completing work
3. **Reference epic context** when working on analysis, architecture, or stories
4. **Maintain epic boundaries** - don't mix work across different epics

### Epic Lifecycle Tracking
The epic document (`bmad-artifacts/epics/[epic-name].md`) serves as the central hub for:
- Epic status and progress tracking
- Links to all related artifacts
- Summary of key findings and decisions
- Dependencies and relationships with other epics

## Godot Development Standards (OPINIONATED & NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### GDScript Coding Standards
- **ALWAYS use static typing** - Every variable, parameter, and return type must be explicitly typed
- **Class naming**: Use `class_name` declarations for all reusable classes
- **Naming conventions**: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Documentation**: Every public function MUST have a docstring
- **Error handling**: Proper error checking and graceful failure handling

### Godot Architecture Principles
- **Scene composition over inheritance** - Prefer composition and scene instancing
- **Signal-based communication** - Use signals for loose coupling between systems
- **Single responsibility nodes** - Each node should have one clear purpose
- **Resource efficiency** - Preload small assets, load() dynamically for large ones
- **Proper node hierarchy** - Logical parent-child relationships

### Example GDScript Structure
```gdscript
class_name PlayerShip
extends CharacterBody3D

## A player-controlled spacecraft with movement, weapons, and shields.
## Handles input processing, physics movement, and combat systems.

signal health_changed(new_health: float)
signal shield_depleted()
signal weapon_fired(weapon_type: String)

@export var max_speed: float = 100.0
@export var acceleration: float = 50.0
@export var max_health: float = 100.0

var current_health: float
var shield_strength: float
var is_alive: bool = true

func _ready() -> void:
    current_health = max_health
    
func take_damage(damage: float) -> void:
    current_health = max(0.0, current_health - damage)
    health_changed.emit(current_health)
    
    if current_health <= 0.0:
        _handle_destruction()
```

## Common Development Commands

### Project Setup
```bash
# Run Godot project
Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64.exe --path target/

# Run specific scene
Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64 --path target/ --main-scene scenes/main_menu.tscn

# Run tests (if using GUT framework)
Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64 --path target/ -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd

# Export project for testing
Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64 --path target/ --export-release "Windows Desktop" build/wcs_godot.exe

# Run headless for CI/testing
Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64 --path target/ --headless --script scripts/run_tests.gd

# Check project for errors
Godot_v4.4.1-stable_win64 --path target/ --check-only --headless --script-editor=false --quit 
```

### BMAD Workflow Commands
- Load `bmad-workflow/ide-orchestrator.md` as your active agent
- Use `/analyst` to become Larry for C++ analysis
- Use `/architect` to become Mo for Godot design
- Use `/dev` to become Dev for GDScript implementation
- Use `/bmad:create_prd {system_name}` to initiate PRD creation
- Use `/bmad:design_architecture {system_name}` to start architecture design
- Use `/bmad:create_story {epic_name}` to generate user stories
- Use `/bmad:implement_story {story_id}` to begin implementation
- Use `/bmad:validate_feature {feature_name}` to start QA validation
- Use `/bmad:run_checklist {checklist_name}` to execute quality gates

## WCS-Godot Conversion Guidelines

### Analysis Phase (Larry)
- Always examine actual C++ source code in `source/` submodule
- Focus on gameplay-critical systems first
- Document data flow and system interactions
- Identify performance-critical sections
- Create detailed analysis reports in `bmad-artifacts/docs/`

### Architecture Phase (Mo)
- Design Godot-native solutions, not direct C++ ports
- Leverage Godot's node system and signals
- Plan for maintainability
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Challenge any non-optimal architectural decisions

### Implementation Phase (Dev)
- Follow architecture specifications exactly
- Use static typing for ALL code
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Document all public APIs
- Optimize for readability
- **Create Package Documentation**: For each significant code package/module in `target/`, create a short `CLAUDE.md` file explaining the package's purpose, key classes, usage examples, architecture notes, integration points, performance considerations, and testing notes

### Quality Assurance (QA)
- Validate feature parity with original WCS
- We do not need explicit performance tests
- Verify code quality standards
- Ensure proper documentation
- Final approval before feature completion

## Key Integration Points

### Source Code Analysis
- **Location**: `source/` submodule contains WCS C++ code
- **Focus Areas**: `source/code/` directory structure
- **Key Systems**: Ship movement, weapons, AI, UI, missions
- **Analysis Output**: Store in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/[system]-analysis.md`

### Godot Implementation
- **Location**: `target/` submodule contains Godot project
- **Scene Organization**: Logical separation of systems
- **Script Location**: Follow Godot project structure
- **Asset Management**: Efficient resource loading patterns

### BMAD Artifacts (Epic-Based Organization)
- **PRDs**: Product requirements in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/`
- **Architecture**: Technical specifications in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/`
- **Stories**: Implementation tasks in `bmad-artifacts/stories/[epic-name]/`
- **Reviews**: Approval documentation in `bmad-artifacts/reviews/[epic-name]/`
- **Epic Tracking**: Epic definitions and status in `bmad-artifacts/epics/[epic-name].md`

## Critical Rules (ENFORCED BY BMAD)

1. **Sequential Workflow**: Must follow PRD → Architecture → Stories → Implementation
2. **Single Epic Focus**: Only one epic in progress at a time
3. **Quality Gates**: Cannot skip approval checkpoints
4. **Documentation**: All artifacts must be documented and approved
5. **Epic-Based Organization**: All docs/stories organized under respective epic folders
6. **Epic Updates**: Agents must update parent epic documents with status/progress
7. **Static Typing**: No untyped GDScript code allowed
8. **Godot Best Practices**: Architecture must be Godot-native, not ported C++
9. **Version Control**: MUST commit after each major workflow phase completion

## Git Workflow (MANDATORY)

### Commit Requirements
**CRITICAL**: All generated artifacts and code must be committed after each major BMAD workflow step to maintain project integrity and track progress.

### Commit Schedule
- **After Analysis**: Commit `bmad-artifacts/docs/[system]-analysis.md` and related documents
- **After PRD Creation**: Commit `bmad-artifacts/docs/[system]-prd.md` and project briefs

## Custom Slash Commands (Planned)

- `/project:start_conversion {system_name}` - Initialize BMAD workflow for WCS system
- `/project:analyze_cpp {file_or_system}` - Deep C++ code analysis with Larry
- `/project:design_godot {wcs_system}` - Architect Godot implementation with Mo
- `/project:implement_feature {story_name}` - GDScript implementation with Dev
- `/project:validate_conversion {feature_name}` - Quality validation with QA
- `/project:check_workflow` - Verify BMAD workflow compliance

## Success Metrics

- **Feature Parity**: Converted systems maintain WCS gameplay feel
- **Code Quality**: All code meets static typing and documentation standards
- **Performance**: Godot implementation meets or exceeds WCS performance
- **Maintainability**: Code is clean, well-documented, and testable
- **Architecture**: Systems are Godot-native and leverage engine strengths

## Important Notes

- **Source Reference**: Always reference specific files in `source/` when analyzing
- **Target Implementation**: All Godot code goes in `target/` submodule
- **BMAD Compliance**: Follow workflow strictly - no shortcuts allowed
- **Quality First**: Never compromise on code quality for speed
- **Godot Native**: Design for Godot, don't just port C++ patterns

Remember: This is not just a code conversion - it's a complete reimagining of WCS systems using Godot's strengths while preserving the original gameplay experience.
