# Godot Architecture Quality Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures that Godot architecture designs meet the highest standards for WCS-Godot conversion projects. Use this checklist during architecture review and before approving any architecture document.

## Reviewer: Mo (Godot Architect)
**Usage**: Run this checklist before finalizing any architecture document in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[system]-architecture.md`

## Architecture Foundation

### System Understanding
- [ ] **WCS System Analysis**: Architecture references specific WCS system analysis document
- [ ] **Requirements Alignment**: All PRD requirements are addressed in the architecture
- [ ] **Scope Boundaries**: Clear definition of what is and isn't included in this system
- [ ] **Integration Points**: Well-defined interfaces with other WCS systems being converted

### Godot Engine Alignment
- [ ] **Engine Strengths**: Architecture leverages Godot's unique capabilities (nodes, signals, scenes)
- [ ] **Native Patterns**: Uses Godot-native solutions, not direct C++ ports
- [ ] **Performance Conscious**: Design considers Godot's performance characteristics
- [ ] **Platform Compatibility**: Architecture works across target platforms

## Node Architecture Design

### Scene Structure
- [ ] **Logical Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships make conceptual sense
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each node has one clear, well-defined purpose
- [ ] **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefers scene composition over class inheritance
- [ ] **Reusable Components**: Common functionality extracted into reusable scenes

### Node Selection
- [ ] **Appropriate Node Types**: Uses the most suitable Godot node types for each purpose
- [ ] **Minimal Node Count**: Avoids unnecessary nodes while maintaining clarity
- [ ] **Built-in Functionality**: Leverages built-in node capabilities before custom solutions
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Node structure optimized for runtime performance

## Communication Architecture

### Signal Design
- [ ] **Signal-Based Communication**: Uses signals for loose coupling between systems
- [ ] **Clear Signal Contracts**: All signals have well-defined purposes and parameters
- [ ] **Typed Signal Parameters**: All signal parameters are properly typed
- [ ] **Signal Documentation**: Signal usage and flow clearly documented

### Event Flow
- [ ] **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Clear, predictable data flow patterns
- [ ] **Event Propagation**: Logical event bubbling and handling patterns
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] **State Management**: Clear state management and synchronization patterns

## Code Architecture

### GDScript Design
- [ ] **Static Typing**: 100% static typing requirement addressed
- [ ] **Class Structure**: Clear class hierarchies and responsibilities
- [ ] **Interface Design**: Well-defined public APIs and method signatures
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Efficient resource loading and cleanup patterns

### Performance Architecture
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage and garbage collection considerations
- [ ] **CPU Optimization**: Performance-critical paths identified and optimized
- [ ] **GPU Considerations**: Rendering and shader usage planned appropriately
- [ ] **Asset Loading**: Efficient asset loading and caching strategies

## Integration Architecture

### System Boundaries
- [ ] **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined boundaries between this and other systems
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency relationships and loading order
- [ ] **Configuration System**: Data-driven configuration and customization support
- [ ] **Testing Interfaces**: Architecture supports unit and integration testing

### WCS Compatibility
- [ ] **Feature Parity**: Architecture supports all required WCS functionality
- [ ] **Gameplay Feel**: Design preserves authentic WCS gameplay experience
- [ ] **Performance Targets**: Architecture can meet or exceed WCS performance
- [ ] **Asset Compatibility**: Supports WCS asset formats or conversion pipelines

## Documentation Quality

### Technical Specification
- [ ] **Implementation Guidance**: Clear guidance for developers implementing the design
- [ ] **Code Examples**: Concrete GDScript examples for key patterns
- [ ] **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representations of system structure and flow
- [ ] **Decision Rationale**: Reasoning behind key architectural decisions documented

### Quality Standards
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Architecture supports long-term maintenance and evolution
- [ ] **Testability**: Design enables comprehensive testing strategies
- [ ] **Scalability**: Architecture can handle growth and additional features
- [ ] **Debugging Support**: Design includes debugging and diagnostic capabilities

## Final Validation

### Compliance Check
- [ ] **BMAD Workflow**: Architecture follows approved BMAD methodology
- [ ] **Godot Best Practices**: Adheres to established Godot development patterns
- [ ] **WCS Conversion Goals**: Supports overall conversion project objectives
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: Meets all established quality and performance criteria

### Approval Criteria
- [ ] **Technical Soundness**: Architecture is technically feasible and robust
- [ ] **Implementation Ready**: Provides sufficient detail for development teams
- [ ] **Stakeholder Alignment**: Meets requirements of all project stakeholders
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Identifies and mitigates potential technical risks

## Checklist Completion
