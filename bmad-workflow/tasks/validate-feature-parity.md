# Task: Validate Feature Parity

## Objective
To validate that a converted Godot feature achieves functional and experiential parity with the original Wing Commander Saga system. This task focuses on gameplay feel, behavior, and core mechanics, not just technical correctness.

## Prerequisites
- An implemented feature or story that is ready for quality assurance testing.
- Access to a playable build of the Godot project.
- Access to the original Wing Commander Saga game for comparison.
- The user story and its acceptance criteria.

## Validation Process

### 1. Understand the Original Feature
- Review the WCS analysis document for the original system.
- If necessary, play the original Wing Commander Saga to experience the feature firsthand.
- Take notes on the specific behaviors, timings, and "feel" of the original system.

### 2. Test the Godot Implementation
- Systematically test the new implementation against the user story's acceptance criteria.
- Go beyond the acceptance criteria to perform exploratory testing.
- Compare the behavior of the Godot feature directly against the original WCS feature. Does it move the same? Fire the same? React the same?

### 3. Document Findings
- Create a validation report in `bmad-artifacts/reviews/[epic-name]/[story-id]-validation-report.md`.
- Document any deviations from the original WCS feature, no matter how small.
- Categorize findings:
    - **Parity Met**: The feature is a faithful conversion.
    - **Minor Deviation**: The feature works but has small differences in feel or behavior that need adjustment.
    - **Major Deviation**: The feature is functionally incorrect or feels significantly different from the original.
    - **Bug**: A clear error or crash.

### 4. Create Bug Reports or Feedback Stories
- For any bugs or major deviations, create new bug-fix stories in the backlog.
- For minor deviations, provide clear feedback to the development team for refinement.

## Output Format
- A validation report document.
- A set of new bug-fix or refinement stories in the backlog, if required.
- A final "pass" or "fail" status for the feature's parity.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] The validation was performed by comparing directly with the original WCS game.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria were tested.
- [ ] The "feel" of the feature was considered, not just its function.
- [ ] All deviations and bugs are clearly documented with steps to reproduce.
- [ ] The final assessment of parity is clear and justified.

## Workflow Integration
- **Input**: An implemented feature ready for QA.
- **Output**: A validation report and potentially new bug-fix stories.
- **Next Steps**: A "pass" status means the feature can be considered for final approval. A "fail" status sends the feature back for rework.
- **Epic Update**: Update the parent epic and story with the results of the validation.

## Notes for QA
- You are the guardian of the WCS soul. Your primary question is: "Does this *feel* like Wing Commander?"
- Be meticulous. Small details in timing, speed, and feedback can make a huge difference in gameplay experience.
- Record videos or GIFs to compare the original and the conversion side-by-side if necessary. This provides undeniable evidence for your findings.
