# Task: Write GDScript Unit Tests

## Objective
To write comprehensive unit tests for a specific GDScript class or feature, ensuring its logic is correct, robust, and meets all requirements. This task is critical for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.

## Prerequisites
- The GDScript code to be tested has been implemented.
- A testing framework (like GUT) is set up in the project.
- A clear understanding of the feature's expected behavior and acceptance criteria.

## Input Requirements
- **Script Path**: The path to the `.gd` file that needs to be tested.
- **Story ID**: The user story associated with the feature.
- **Test Scope**: Specific functions or behaviors to be covered by the tests.

## Testing Process

### 1. Identify Test Cases
- Review the user story's acceptance criteria to derive test cases.
- Analyze the code to identify all logical paths, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential failure points.
- Consider both "happy path" scenarios and error conditions.

### 2. Write Test Scripts
- Create a new test script in the `target/tests/` directory, following the project's naming conventions (e.g., `test_[script_name].gd`).
- Write individual test functions for each test case. Test functions should be small and focused on a single behavior.
- Use descriptive names for test functions that clearly state what they are testing.
- Use assertions to verify that the code behaves as expected.

### 3. Mock Dependencies
- If the code under test has external dependencies (e.g., other nodes, singletons), use mocking or stubbing techniques to isolate the unit of code being tested.
- This ensures that the test is focused only on the logic of the specific script.

### 4. Run Tests
- Execute the tests using the project's testing framework.
- Ensure all new and existing tests pass.
- Debug and fix any issues in the implementation or the tests themselves until all tests pass.

## Output Format
- A new `.gd` test script file located in the `target/tests/` directory.
- Potentially, modifications to the implementation code to fix bugs discovered during testing.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Tests cover all acceptance criteria from the user story.
- [ ] Tests cover both expected outcomes and error-handling paths.
- [ ] Tests are isolated and do not depend on the state of other tests.
- [ ] Assertions are specific and clearly validate the expected behavior.
- [ ] The test script is clean, readable, and follows project conventions.
- [ ] All tests are passing.

## Workflow Integration
- **Input**: Implemented GDScript code.
- **Output**: A corresponding unit test script.
- **Next Steps**: Code with passing tests is ready for formal code review.
- **Epic Update**: Update the story to indicate that unit tests have been written and are passing.

## Notes for Dev (GDScript Developer)
- Writing tests is not an afterthought; it's a core part of implementation.
- Good tests are as important as the implementation code itself.
- Think like an adversary: try to break your own code. What inputs would cause it to fail?
- A high level of test coverage is expected for all new logic.
