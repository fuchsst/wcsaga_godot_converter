# Task: Create WCS User Story

## Objective
Create a well-defined, implementable user story for WCS-Godot conversion with clear acceptance criteria, technical requirements, and proper dependency management following BMAD methodology.

## Prerequisites
- Approved PRD document in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/`
- Approved architecture document in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/`
- Epic definition and scope established
- Understanding of story dependencies

## Input Requirements
- **Epic Reference**: The epic this story belongs to
- **Story Scope**: Specific functionality to be implemented
- **Architecture Reference**: Relevant architecture components
- **Dependency Information**: Prerequisites and related stories

## Story Creation Process

### 1. Story Definition
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title that explains the story's purpose
- **User Perspective**: Define who benefits from this functionality
- **Functionality**: Specific capability or feature being implemented
- **Business Value**: Why this story matters for the conversion

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Definition
- **Specific**: Each criterion must be precise and unambiguous
- **Testable**: All criteria must be objectively verifiable
- **Measurable**: Include concrete metrics where applicable
- **Complete**: Cover all aspects of the required functionality

### 3. Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Reference**: Link to relevant architecture components
- **Implementation Guidance**: Specific technical approach and patterns
- **Performance Criteria**: Frame rate, memory, and efficiency requirements
- **Integration Points**: How this story connects with other systems

### 4. Dependency Management
- **Prerequisites**: Stories that must be completed first
- **Blockers**: External dependencies that could delay implementation
- **Related Stories**: Other stories that interact with this one
- **Impact Analysis**: How this story affects other planned work

## Story Structure Template

Use the template from `bmad-workflow/templates/wcs-story-template.md` to create the story file.

## Story Quality Standards

### Size Guidelines
- **Small Stories**: 1-3 days of development work maximum
- **Single Responsibility**: Each story should have one clear purpose
- **Independent**: Minimal dependencies on incomplete work
- **Valuable**: Delivers meaningful progress toward conversion goals

### Acceptance Criteria Standards
- **Specific**: No ambiguous or vague requirements
- **Testable**: Can be objectively verified as complete
- **Complete**: Covers all aspects of the functionality
- **Realistic**: Achievable within the story's scope

### Technical Requirements Standards
- **Architecture Aligned**: References approved architecture components
- **Godot Native**: Uses appropriate Godot patterns and features
- **Performance Conscious**: Includes relevant performance criteria
- **Integration Aware**: Considers connections with other systems

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] The story must pass all criteria in the `bmad-workflow/checklists/story-readiness-checklist.md`.
- [ ] The story's Definition of Done must align with the `bmad-workflow/checklists/story-definition-of-done-checklist.md`.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are specific and testable.
- [ ] Technical requirements reference an approved architecture document.
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly identified.
- [ ] The story is appropriately sized (1-3 days of work).

## Workflow Integration
- **Input**: Approved PRD and architecture documents
- **Output**: Well-defined user story in `bmad-artifacts/stories/[epic-name]/[STORY-nnn]-[story-name].md` (where nnn is an increasing number)
- **Next Steps**: Story approval before implementation begins
- **Dependencies**: Cannot create stories without approved architecture
- **Epic Update**: After creating story, update the parent epic document in `bmad-artifacts/epics/[epic-name].md` with new story status

## Success Criteria
- Story provides clear implementation guidance
- All acceptance criteria are testable and complete
- Technical approach is sound and architecture-aligned
- Dependencies are properly identified and managed
- Story is appropriately sized for efficient implementation

## Notes for SallySM (Story Manager)
- Enforce BMAD workflow rules strictly - no shortcuts allowed
- Ensure all prerequisites are met before story creation
- Break down complex requirements into manageable stories
- Validate that acceptance criteria are truly testable
- Check that technical requirements align with approved architecture
- Verify that story dependencies are properly managed
- Update the parent epic with the story status

## BMAD Workflow Compliance
- **Prerequisites**: PRD and Architecture must be approved
- **Approval Required**: Story must be approved before implementation
- **Quality Gates**: All checklist items must be satisfied
- **Documentation**: Store completed story in `bmad-artifacts/stories/[epic-name]/` directory
- **Next Phase**: Implementation cannot begin without approved story
- **Single Epic Rule**: Ensure only one epic is in progress at a time
