# Task: Design Godot Architecture

## Objective
Design an optimal Godot engine architecture for a WCS system based on analysis from the WCS Analyst. Create a detailed technical specification that leverages Godot's strengths while maintaining the essential functionality and feel of the original WCS system.

## Prerequisites
- Completed WCS system analysis document in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/`
- Understanding of Godot engine architecture and best practices
- Knowledge of the target system's requirements and constraints

## Input Requirements
- **WCS Analysis Document**: Detailed analysis of the original system
- **System Requirements**: Performance, functionality, and integration requirements
- **Godot Version**: Target Godot version and feature set
- **Architecture Constraints**: Any limitations or specific requirements

## Design Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Review WCS system analysis for key functionality
- Identify performance requirements and constraints
- Determine integration points with other Godot systems
- Establish quality and maintainability standards

### 2. Godot Architecture Mapping
- **Node Structure**: Design optimal node hierarchy and composition
- **Scene Organization**: Plan scene structure and instantiation patterns
- **Signal Architecture**: Design event-driven communication patterns
- **Resource Management**: Plan asset loading and memory management
- **State Management**: Design state machines and data flow

### 3. Technical Specification
- **Core Classes**: Define main GDScript classes and their responsibilities
- **Interface Design**: Specify public APIs and method signatures
- **Data Structures**: Design efficient data representation
- **Performance Strategy**: Plan optimization approaches
- **Error Handling**: Design robust error handling and recovery

### 4. Integration Planning
- **System Boundaries**: Define clear interfaces with other systems
- **Event System**: Design signal-based communication patterns
- **Resource Sharing**: Plan shared resource access and management
- **Configuration**: Design data-driven configuration systems

## Godot-Specific Design Principles

### Node Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each node has one clear purpose
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer scene composition
- **Logical Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships make sense
- **Performance Conscious**: Minimize node count where appropriate

### Scene Design
- **Modular Scenes**: Self-contained, reusable components
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined scene APIs
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal loading and instantiation
- **Maintainable Structure**: Easy to understand and modify

### Signal Architecture
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize direct dependencies
- **Clear Naming**: Descriptive signal names and parameters
- **Event-Driven**: Reactive system design
- **Documentation**: Every signal purpose documented

### GDScript Patterns
- **Static Typing**: All code must be fully typed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and lifecycle
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and data structures

## Output Format

Create a detailed architecture document (`architecture.md`) and two supplementary documents in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/`.

The main architecture document should follow this structure:

### Supplementary Document 1: [System Name] - Godot Files

A markdown file named `[system-name]-godot-files.md` listing all key proposed Godot script files (`.gd`) and scene files (`.tscn`) for the system.

**Format:**
```markdown
# Godot System: [System Name] - Proposed Files List

## Core Scenes
- `res://scenes/system/[system_name]/main_[system_name].tscn`: Main scene for the [System Name].
- `res://scenes/system/[system_name]/components/component_a.tscn`: Reusable scene for Component A.
- ...

## Core Scripts
- `res://scripts/system/[system_name]/[system_name]_manager.gd`: Manages the overall [System Name] logic.
- `res://scripts/system/[system_name]/components/component_a_controller.gd`: Script for Component A.
- ...

## Autoloads/Singletons (if new or heavily used by this system)
- `res://autoloads/new_global_manager.gd`: Description of its role.
- ...
```

### Supplementary Document 2: [System Name] - Godot Dependencies

A markdown file named `[system-name]-godot-dependencies.md` detailing the proposed interactions and dependencies between the Godot files.

**Format:**
```markdown
# Godot System: [System Name] - Proposed Dependencies

## Scene: `res://scenes/system/[system_name]/main_[system_name].tscn`
**Instances/Uses:**
- `res://scenes/system/[system_name]/components/component_a.tscn` (as child node `ComponentA_Instance`)
- `res://scripts/system/[system_name]/[system_name]_manager.gd` (as script attached to root)
**Signals Connected (Emitted by this scene/its scripts):**
- `system_initialized` (from `[system_name]_manager.gd`) connected to `HUDManager.on_system_ready`.
**Signals Connected (Listened to by this scene/its scripts):**
- `player_input_action` (from `InputManagerAutoload`) connected to `[system_name]_manager.gd`'s `_on_player_action` method.

## Script: `res://scripts/system/[system_name]/components/component_a_controller.gd`
**References/Uses:**
- `MyCustomResourceType` (from `res://resources/custom_types/my_resource.gd`)

*(This document should clearly outline how scenes are composed, how scripts are attached, which scripts reference others or autoloads, and key signal connections planned.)*
```

## Workflow Integration
- **Input**: WCS system analysis from Larry (WCS Analyst)
- **Output**: Detailed architecture document (`architecture.md`), proposed Godot file list (`godot-files.md`), and Godot dependency map (`godot-dependencies.md`) in `bmad-artifacts/docs/[epic-name]/`
- **Next Steps**: Architecture feeds into GDScript Developer for implementation
- **Dependencies**: May require coordination with other system architectures
- **Epic Update**: After completing architecture, update the parent epic document in `bmad-artifacts/epics/[epic-name].md` with architecture status and key design decisions

## Success Criteria
- Architecture provides clear implementation roadmap
- All technical decisions are justified and documented
- Performance requirements can be achieved
- Integration with other systems is well-defined
- Implementation complexity is manageable
- Code quality standards are enforced

## Notes for Mo (Godot Architect)
- Be ruthlessly opinionated about Godot best practices.
- Don't compromise on architecture quality for convenience.
- Think about long-term maintainability and scalability.
- Consider performance implications of every design decision.
- Leverage Godot's unique strengths (nodes, signals, scenes).
- Design for testability and modularity.
- Document the reasoning behind architectural choices.
- Challenge any requirements that lead to poor architecture.
- The `godot-files.md` and `godot-dependencies.md` documents are critical for Dev. They should clearly articulate your proposed file structure, scene instancing, script attachments, and key communication pathways (like signal connections or direct script references). This provides a concrete blueprint for implementation.
