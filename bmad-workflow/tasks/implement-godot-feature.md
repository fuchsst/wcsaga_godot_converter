# Task: Implement Godot Feature

## Objective
To implement a new feature or capability in Godot based on an approved user story and architecture. This task is for creating net-new functionality, as opposed to directly converting existing C++ code.

## Prerequisites
- An approved user story with clear acceptance criteria.
- An approved architecture document for the system.
- The foundational scene and script files have been created in the `target/` project.

## Input Requirements
- **Story ID**: The user story to be implemented.
- **Architecture Documents**: The relevant architecture specifications.
- **Target Godot Files**: The `.gd` and `.tscn` files to be implemented or modified.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Understand the Requirements
- Thoroughly read the user story to understand the desired feature and its acceptance criteria.
- Review the architecture document to understand how the new feature should integrate with the existing structure.

### 2. Implement the Feature
- Write new GDScript code or modify existing code to implement the feature.
- **ALWAYS use static typing**.
- Adhere strictly to the approved architecture. Do not introduce new architectural patterns without consulting the Godot Architect (Mo).
- Use signals for communication and follow all project coding standards.
- Create any new scenes or nodes required by the feature, ensuring they fit within the established architecture.

### 3. Document and Test
- Write clear docstrings and comments for all new code.
- Update existing documentation if the feature changes existing behavior.
- Perform preliminary testing to ensure the feature works and doesn't introduce regressions.
- Write unit tests for the new logic.

## Output Format
- New or modified `.gd` and `.tscn` files in the `target/` project.
- New unit test files in the `target/tests/` directory.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] The implementation fulfills all acceptance criteria in the user story.
- [ ] The code is fully statically typed.
- [ ] The implementation adheres to the approved architecture and project coding standards.
- [ ] New code is documented with docstrings and comments.
- [ ] Unit tests have been written for the new functionality.
- [ ] The feature is well-integrated and does not break existing systems.

## Workflow Integration
- **Input**: An approved user story and architecture.
- **Output**: A new, implemented feature ready for review.
- **Next Steps**: The implemented feature will be reviewed by QA and the Godot Architect.
- **Epic Update**: Update the parent epic and the story file to reflect the implementation status.

## Notes for Dev (GDScript Developer)
- Your focus is on building robust, maintainable, and well-tested features.
- Adherence to the existing architecture is paramount. Do not deviate.
- If the requirements seem to conflict with the architecture, flag it for discussion immediately.
- Ensure your implementation is not just functional but also performant and clean.
