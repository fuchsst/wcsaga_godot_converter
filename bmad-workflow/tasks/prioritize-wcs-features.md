# Task: Prioritize WCS Features

## Objective
To analyze and prioritize the features and systems of Wing Commander Saga for conversion, creating a high-level roadmap that balances technical dependencies, development effort, and value to the project.

## Prerequisites
- A general understanding of the WCS systems, based on initial analysis or existing documentation.
- A clear vision for the WCS-Godot conversion project.

## Input Requirements
- **List of WCS Systems/Features**: A list of potential candidates for conversion.
- **Project Goals**: The overall objectives of the conversion (e.g., create a playable demo, convert core gameplay first).
- **Stakeholder Input**: Feedback from stakeholders on what they consider most important.

## Prioritization Process

### 1. Information Gathering
- Review any existing high-level analysis of WCS systems.
- Consult with the WCS Analyst (Larry) to understand technical dependencies and complexities.
- Consult with the Godot Architect (Mo) to understand potential implementation challenges and opportunities.

### 2. Define Prioritization Criteria
- Establish a clear set of criteria for prioritization. This may include:
    - **Core Gameplay Impact**: How essential is this feature to the core WCS experience?
    - **Technical Dependency**: Is this a foundational system that others depend on?
    - **Development Effort**: How complex and time-consuming will the conversion be?
    - **Risk**: What is the technical risk associated with this feature?
    - **Value Proposition**: How much value does converting this feature deliver to the project's goals?

### 3. Rank and Group Features
- Score each feature or system against the defined criteria.
- Group related features into logical milestones or epics.
- Create a prioritized backlog of epics and features.

### 4. Create High-Level Roadmap
- Develop a visual roadmap that outlines the planned sequence of conversion.
- Define key milestones and the features that will be delivered in each.
- Document the rationale behind the prioritization decisions.

## Output Format
- A prioritized list of epics and features, stored in a document like `bmad-artifacts/docs/project-overview/conversion-roadmap.md`.
- A clear set of defined epics in `bmad-artifacts/epics/` that are ready to be fleshed out.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Prioritization criteria are clear and have been applied consistently.
- [ ] The roadmap is logical and takes technical dependencies into account.
- [ ] The prioritization aligns with the overall project goals.
- [ ] The rationale for the prioritization is clearly documented.
- [ ] The output is actionable and can be used to drive the creation of PRDs and epics.

## Workflow Integration
- **Input**: High-level project goals and a list of WCS systems.
- **Output**: A prioritized roadmap and a set of defined epics.
- **Next Steps**: The prioritized epics and features will be used to create detailed PRDs via the `Create Conversion PRD` task.
- **Epic Update**: This task often precedes the detailed creation of most epics, but it will populate the initial list of epics to be worked on.

## Notes for Curly (Conversion Manager)
- This is a strategic task. Think about the big picture.
- Balancing dependencies, effort, and value is key. A feature might be high value, but if it depends on three other complex systems, it can't be first.
- Your goal is to create a logical and achievable plan that delivers value incrementally.
- Be prepared to justify your decisions to stakeholders.
