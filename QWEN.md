## Qwen Added Memories
- Updated .claude/commands and .claude/hooks files to organize tasks in subfolders by story ID instead of storing them directly in .workflow/tasks/
- Updated Makefile to support development commands for both converter and data_converter modules with separate and combined commands for testing, formatting, linting, and type checking.
