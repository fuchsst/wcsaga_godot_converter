# Graph System

This directory contains the dependency graph system for tracking codebase relationships in the Wing Commander Saga to Godot migration.

## Overview

The graph system implements a robust dependency graph for tracking relationships between codebase entities. It provides:

1. **Dependency Tracking**: Track dependencies between different entities in the codebase
2. **Concurrency Control**: Handle concurrent access to the graph with proper locking
3. **Persistence**: Save and load graph data to/from files
4. **Topological Ordering**: Determine migration order based on dependencies

## Key Components

- `dependency_graph.py` - Core dependency graph implementation using NetworkX
- `graph_manager.py` - Manager for the dependency graph with concurrency control
- `file_monitor.py` - File monitoring for real-time graph updates

## Integration with Other Systems

The graph system integrates with several other systems:

- **Orchestrator**: Provides dependency information for task ordering
- **Codebase Analyst**: Receives dependency information from analysis
- **Prompt Engineering**: Provides context for prompt creation
- **Validation System**: Uses dependency information for validation
