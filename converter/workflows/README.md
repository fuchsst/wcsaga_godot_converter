# Workflows

This directory contains the process definitions for orchestrating the migration.

Based on the "Agentic Migration with CLI Agents" document, we support two workflow models:

- `sequential_process.py` - Sequential workflow implementation for atomic coding tasks
- `hierarchical_process.py` - Hierarchical workflow implementation for managing overall migration
- `migration_campaign.py` - Overall migration campaign orchestration
