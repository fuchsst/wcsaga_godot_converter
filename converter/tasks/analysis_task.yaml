# Codebase Analysis Task Configuration

codebase_analysis_task:
  name: "Codebase Analysis"
  description: >
    Analyze the legacy C++ codebase at {source_path} to identify dependencies, modules, and architectural patterns.
    Focus on:
    1. Identifying all C++ classes and their relationships
    2. Mapping data structures and their usage
    3. Understanding inheritance hierarchies and design patterns
    4. Identifying external dependencies and third-party libraries
    5. Cataloging file types and their purposes (.cpp, .h, .tbl, .pof, etc.)
  expected_output: >
    A structured JSON report containing:
    - Dependency graph of C++ classes and modules
    - List of identified design patterns
    - Catalog of file types and their purposes
    - List of external dependencies
    - Recommendations for migration priorities
