# Context Engineering

This directory contains the guidance artifacts and rulebooks for the AI agents.

These artifacts are essential for ensuring high-quality, consistent output in the LangGraph-based migration process:

- `STYLE_GUIDE.md` - Architectural style guide for Godot/GDScript
- `RULES.md` - Virtual constitution with strict principles for AI actions
- `TEMPLATES/` - Scaffolding templates for common Godot file types
- `GOLD_STANDARDS/` - Curated examples of perfect Godot implementations

## Integration with Other Systems

The context engineering system integrates with several systems:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Provides guidance artifacts for prompt creation in LangGraph nodes
- **Refactoring Specialist**: Ensures consistent output quality through style guides and templates
- **Validation System**: Provides standards for quality assurance and test validation
- **Orchestrator**: Ensures consistent application of rules throughout the LangGraph migration process
