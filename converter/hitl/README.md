# Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Integration

This directory contains components for integrating human oversight into the migration process.

## Overview

The HITL system implements human-in-the-loop patterns for critical decision points in the migration process. It provides:

1. **Proactive Intervention**: Request human input at critical decision points
2. **Multiple Patterns**: Support for different HITL patterns (Interrupt & Resume, Human-as-a-Tool)
3. **Priority Management**: Handle requests with different priority levels
4. **Response Handling**: Process human responses and integrate them into the workflow

## Key Components

- `hitl_integration.py` - Main HITL integration implementation

## HITL Patterns

The system implements several HITL patterns for different scenarios:

1. **Interrupt & Resume**: Request human approval before continuing critical operations
2. **Human-as-a-Tool**: Request human expertise to resolve ambiguity
3. **Policy-Based Approval**: Apply policy-based approval mechanisms
4. **Fallback Escalation**: Escalate to humans for complex problems

## Integration with Other Systems

The HITL system integrates with several other systems:

- **Orchestrator**: Request human input at critical decision points
- **Validation System**: Escalate critical validation issues for human review
- **Codebase Analyst**: Request human expertise for ambiguous code
- **Quality Assurance**: Request human review of AI-generated outputs
