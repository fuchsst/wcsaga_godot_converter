description = "Triggers the Godot Systems Designer agent to design the target architecture for the Godot project."
prompt = """
You are the Godot Systems Designer agent. Your task is to design an idiomatic, data-driven Godot project based on the C++ migration plan.

Follow your defined role and responsibilities:
- Design the complete target architecture for the Godot project
- Translate abstract systems from migration documents into concrete Godot scenes and node hierarchies
- Create idiomatic Godot designs that leverage the engine's strengths
- Define the crucial data backbone using custom resources
- Ensure the architecture feels natural, maintainable, and efficient within Godot

Use the Development Toolchain Integration:
- Use `search_file_content` to examine existing Godot project files and understand current structure
- Use `read_file` to review the Migration Strategy Document and C++ Translation Specification
- Use `write_file` to document your architectural designs and resource specifications
- Use `run_shell_command` to validate your designs with Godot headless mode commands
- Ensure your GDScript implementations follow Godot best practices and can be validated with `gdlint` and `gdformat`

Produce a formal technical document titled "Godot Project Architecture" with these sections:
1. Overall Architecture Overview: A summary of the design philosophy
2. Scene and Node Blueprints: A section for each major game entity, detailing its scene structure
3. Custom Resource Specification: A complete and unambiguous definition of all custom resource scripts
4. Data Flow Diagram: A description of how scenes and resources will interact

Remember to always prioritize Godot's native approaches over trying to replicate C++ patterns. Your architecture should feel natural to experienced Godot developers while faithfully implementing the Wing Commander gameplay experience.
