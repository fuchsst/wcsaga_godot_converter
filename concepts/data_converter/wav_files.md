# WAV Files Conversion Requirements

## Overview
WAV files contain sound effects, music, and voice acting used throughout Wing Commander Saga. These audio files need to be converted to Ogg Vorbis format for better compression and compatibility with Godot's audio system, following Godot's feature-based organization principles.

## File Types and Conversion Requirements

### Sound Effects
**Purpose**: Weapon sounds, explosion effects, and UI feedback
**Source Format**: WAV format (various bit depths and sample rates)
**Target Format**: Ogg Vorbis with appropriate quality settings
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Convert to standardized sample rate (44.1kHz or 48kHz)
- Apply appropriate bit rate for quality/size balance
- Maintain mono/stereo channel configuration
- Preserve dynamic range and sound characteristics
- Handle looping properties for continuous effects

### Music Tracks
**Purpose**: Background music for menus, missions, and cutscenes
**Source Format**: WAV format (typically higher quality)
**Target Format**: Ogg Vorbis with high quality settings
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Convert to standardized sample rate (44.1kHz)
- Use higher bit rates for music quality
- Maintain stereo channel configuration
- Preserve full frequency range and dynamics
- Handle seamless looping for ambient tracks

### Voice Acting
**Purpose**: Pilot communication, mission briefings, and character dialogue
**Source Format**: WAV format with voice-optimized encoding
**Target Format**: Ogg Vorbis with speech-optimized settings
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Convert to standardized sample rate (22.05kHz or 44.1kHz)
- Use appropriate bit rates for speech clarity
- Apply noise reduction if needed
- Maintain consistent volume levels
- Handle dialogue timing and synchronization

### Ambient Sounds
**Purpose**: Environmental audio for space, nebulae, and planetary surfaces
**Source Format**: WAV format with spatial characteristics
**Target Format**: Ogg Vorbis with 3D audio properties
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Convert to appropriate sample rate for environmental audio
- Maintain spatial properties for 3D positioning
- Apply reverb and environmental effects
- Handle long looped samples efficiently
- Preserve atmospheric qualities

## Conversion Process

### 1. Format Analysis Phase
- Validate WAV file headers and structure
- Extract audio properties (sample rate, bit depth, channels)
- Identify intended use (SFX, music, voice, ambient)
- Check for special properties or metadata
- Assess audio quality and characteristics

### 2. Quality Optimization Phase
- Apply appropriate sample rate conversion
- Optimize bit depth and format for target use
- Apply noise reduction and audio cleanup
- Normalize volume levels where appropriate
- Preserve important audio characteristics

### 3. Format Conversion Phase
- Convert to Ogg Vorbis with appropriate settings
- Apply different quality levels based on audio type
- Handle stereo/mono conversion if needed
- Maintain loop points and special markers
- Generate multiple quality variants for different platforms

### 4. Metadata Integration Phase
- Embed descriptive metadata in audio files
- Maintain cross-references to game events
- Handle 3D positioning properties
- Preserve timing and synchronization data
- Generate resource definitions for Godot integration
