# FS2 Files Conversion Requirements

## Overview
FS2 (Mission) files contain complete mission definitions including briefing data, initial ship placements, AI directives, and event scripting. These complex binary files need to be parsed and converted to Godot's scene format (.tscn) with associated resource files, following Godot's feature-based organization principles.

## File Structure and Components

### Mission Header Information
**Purpose**: Basic mission identification and properties
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Extract mission name and description
- Parse author and version information
- Convert mission type (single player, multiplayer)
- Map skybox and ambient lighting settings
- Extract music and audio environment settings

### Briefing Data
**Purpose**: Mission introduction and objectives presentation
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Parse briefing text with formatting codes
- Extract voice acting references
- Convert objective definitions to Godot MissionObjective resources
- Map briefing cutscene references
- Maintain briefing UI layout information

### Initial State Definitions
**Purpose**: Starting conditions and entity placements
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Parse initial ship placements with positions and orientations
- Convert wing formations and assignments
- Map starting weapon loadouts
- Extract initial AI directives and goals
- Handle player ship positioning and setup

### Event Scripting
**Purpose**: Dynamic mission flow and conditional triggers
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Parse event conditions and triggers
- Convert event actions and consequences
- Map timeline-based events
- Handle variable and flag references
- Convert sexp (symbolic expression) logic to Godot equivalent

### Message System
**Purpose**: In-mission communications and notifications
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Parse message definitions with sender/receiver information
- Convert message triggers and conditions
- Map audio references for voice acting
- Handle message priority and grouping
- Maintain message history and display properties

### AI Profiles and Behaviors
**Purpose**: Specific AI directives for mission entities
**Conversion Requirements**:
- Parse AI class assignments for ships
- Convert tactical overrides and special behaviors
- Map reinforcement schedules and conditions
- Handle support ship behavior (rearm/repair)
- Maintain wing commander and formation assignments

## Conversion Process

### 1. Binary Parsing Phase
- Read FS2 file header and validate format
- Parse mission data chunks using chunk-based structure
- Extract briefing and fiction text segments
- Handle variable length data sections
- Validate checksums and file integrity

### 2. Data Extraction Phase
- Create intermediate mission data structures
- Parse entity placements and properties
- Extract event graph and conditional logic
- Convert briefing objectives to structured format
- Map all cross-references and dependencies

### 3. Scene Generation Phase
- Create Godot scene structure for mission environment following feature-based organization
- Generate entity nodes with initial properties
- Create event timeline using Godot's animation system
- Generate objective tracking components
- Set up message system nodes

### 4. Resource Integration Phase
- Link converted table data (ships, weapons, etc.) from `/data/` directories
- Integrate converted 3D models and textures from `/entities/` directories
- Connect audio references to converted sound files from `/audio/` directories
- Map animation references to converted animations from `/animations/` directories
- Validate all asset connections using Godot's resource system

## Feature-Based Directory Structure
Following Godot's recommended directory structure:
```
/missions/

```

## System Integration
FS2 missions integrate with various Godot systems:
- `/systems/mission_control/` - Mission management and event processing
- `/systems/ai/` - AI behavior for mission entities
- `/systems/weapon_control/` - Weapon behavior for mission entities
- `/ui/briefing/` - Briefing interface components
- `/ui/debriefing/` - Debriefing interface components

## Closely Related Assets
- Fiction text files (.txt) that accompany missions and are converted to `/text/` directories
- Voice acting files (.wav/.ogg) referenced in briefings and converted to `/audio/` directories
- Cutscene video files referenced in mission flow and converted to `/videos/` directories
- Ship and weapon table data (.tbl/.tbm) referenced in entity definitions and converted to `/data/` directories
- Particle effect definitions used in mission events and converted to `/data/effects/` directories

## Entity Integration
Missions reference entity scenes from `/entities/` directories:
- Ship entities from `/entities/fighters/`, `/entities/capital_ships/`
- Weapon entities from `/entities/weapons/`
- Projectile entities from `/entities/projectiles/`
- Effect entities from `/entities/effects/`
- Environmental entities from `/entities/environment/`

## Common Shared Assets
- Standard briefing UI components used across all missions from `/ui/components/`
- Common event templates for standard mission behaviors from `/systems/mission_control/templates/`
- Shared message templates for standard communications from `/systems/mission_control/templates/`
- Default skybox and environmental settings from `/data/config/graphics/`
- Common reinforcement and support ship patterns from `/data/ai/formations/`
