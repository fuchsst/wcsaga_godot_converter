# Game Sound System Analysis

## Purpose
The game sound system handles sound effect definitions, loading, and management, including 3D positioning, volume control, and sound priorities.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `snd_load()` - Load sound files
- `snd_play()` - Play sound effects
- `snd_stop()` - Stop playing sounds
- Sound property access functions
- 3D sound positioning functions

## Key Components
- **Sound Definitions**: Tables defining sound properties
- **Resource Management**: Loading and caching sound files
- **3D Positioning**: Spatial audio based on object positions
- **Volume Control**: Master and individual sound volume
- **Priority System**: Important sounds override less important ones
- **Looping**: Continuous and triggered sound loops

## Dependencies
- `sound.h` - Core audio system
- `object.h` - 3D positioning of sound sources
- `parse.h` - Sound definition file parsing

## Game Logic Integration
The game sound system enhances audio feedback:
- Provides positional audio for tactical awareness
- Integrates with weapon and explosion effects
- Supports UI feedback through interface sounds
- Enables dynamic music that responds to gameplay
- Manages performance through sound prioritization
