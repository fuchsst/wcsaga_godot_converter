# Jump Node System Analysis

## Purpose
The jump node system handles hyperspace jump points, including their visualization, behavior, and integration with ship warp mechanics. It provides the mechanism for inter-system travel.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `jumpnode_create()` - Creates jump node instances
- `jumpnode_render()` - Renders jump node visuals
- `jumpnode_is_valid()` - Validates jump node for travel
- Jump node property access functions

## Key Components
- **Jump Point Visualization**: Visual representation of hyperspace entry/exit points
- **Warp Integration**: Connection to ship warp in/out mechanics
- **Mission Integration**: Designer-placed jump nodes in missions
- **Activation Logic**: Conditions for jump node availability
- **Visual Effects**: Special effects for active jump nodes

## Dependencies
- `object.h` - Jump nodes as special object types
- `ship.h` - Ship warp mechanics integration
- `model.h` - Visual models for jump nodes
- `mission.h` - Mission-specific jump node placement

## Game Logic Integration
The jump node system enables mission progression:
- Provides mechanism for ships to enter/exit mission space
- Enables inter-system travel in campaign structure
- Supports tactical elements through controlled entry/exit points
- Integrates with AI for coordinated fleet movements
- Connects to mission objectives and story progression
