## Purpose
The UI system provides the foundational user interface framework, including windows, controls, input handling, and general UI components used throughout the game.

## Main Public Interfaces
- Window management and rendering
- Control creation and interaction
- Input handling for mouse and keyboard
- UI event processing system
- Widget and component framework

## Key Components
- **Window System**: Modal and non-modal window management
- **Control Library**: Buttons, sliders, text fields, lists
- **Input Handling**: Mouse, keyboard, and controller input
- **Event System**: UI event propagation and handling
- **Rendering Integration**: Connection to graphics system
- **Skinning System**: Visual appearance customization

## Dependencies
- `graphics.h` - Rendering functions
- `io.h` - Input handling
- Various UI-dependent systems

## Game Logic Integration
The UI system provides the foundation for all interfaces:
- Enables consistent look and feel across all screens
- Provides reusable components for rapid interface development
- Integrates input handling with game controls
- Supports both mouse-driven and keyboard-driven navigation
- Enables modding through skinnable interface elements
