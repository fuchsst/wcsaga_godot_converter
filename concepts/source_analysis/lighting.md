# Lighting System Analysis

## Purpose
The lighting system handles all dynamic and static lighting calculations, including point lights, directional lights, and atmospheric lighting effects.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `light_add()` - Add light sources to scene
- `light_apply()` - Apply lighting to objects
- `light_reset()` - Reset lighting for new frame
- Lighting configuration and settings functions

## Key Components
- **Light Sources**: Point, directional, and spot lights
- **Lighting Models**: Phong, Gouraud, and other shading models
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Real-time light calculation
- **Static Lighting**: Pre-calculated lighting for performance
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Fog, haze, and environmental lighting
- **Performance Optimization**: Level-of-detail lighting

## Dependencies
- `graphics.h` - Rendering functions
- `model.h` - Model vertex and normal data
- `object.h` - Object positioning and properties
- Math libraries for lighting calculations

## Game Logic Integration
The lighting system enhances visual quality:
- Provides realistic illumination of game objects
- Creates atmospheric mood and visual storytelling
- Supports performance through optimization techniques
- Integrates with special effects for dynamic lighting
- Enables modding through configurable light properties
