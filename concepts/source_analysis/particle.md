# Particle System Analysis

## Purpose
The particle system handles special visual effects through particle rendering, including engine trails, explosions, weapon effects, and atmospheric phenomena.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `particle_create()` - Creates particle effects
- `particle_process()` - Updates particles each frame
- `particle_render()` - Renders particle effects
- Particle emitter management functions

## Key Components
- **Particle Emitters**: Sources that generate particles
- **Particle Properties**: Velocity, lifetime, size, color
- **Physics Simulation**: Movement and behavior of particles
- **Rendering**: Efficient drawing of many particles
- **Effect Types**: Trails, explosions, fire, smoke, etc.
- **Lifetime Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired particles

## Dependencies
- `graphics.h` - Rendering functions
- `object.h` - Particle attachment to objects
- `weapon.h` - Weapon effect particles
- `ship.h` - Engine trail particles

## Game Logic Integration
The particle system enhances visual quality:
- Provides visual feedback for ship engines and weapons
- Creates atmospheric effects like smoke and fire
- Enhances explosion and impact effects
- Supports performance through efficient rendering
- Integrates with special effects for rich visuals
