# Object System Analysis

## Purpose
The object system provides the fundamental entity management framework for FreeSpace. All game entities (ships, weapons, asteroids, etc.) are represented as objects with common properties and behaviors.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `object` - Base structure for all game entities
- `obj_create()` - Creates a new object instance
- `obj_delete()` - Removes an object from the game
- `obj_move_all()` - Updates all objects each frame
- `obj_render_all()` - Renders all visible objects
- `obj_collide()` - Handles object collision detection
- `OBJ_INDEX()` - Macro to get object index from pointer

## Key Components
- **Object Types**: Ships, weapons, fireballs, debris, asteroids, etc.
- **Linked Lists**: Efficient object management through free/used lists
- **Physics Integration**: All objects have physics properties
- **Rendering System**: Objects can be rendered with various flags
- **Collision System**: Objects can participate in collision detection
- **Lifetime Management**: Object creation, updating, and destruction
- **Networking Support**: Network signatures for multiplayer

## Dependencies
- `physics.h` - All objects have physics properties
- `model.h` - Objects often have associated models
- `2d.h` - Objects are rendered on screen

## Game Logic Integration
The object system is the foundation of FreeSpace:
- Provides common interface for all game entities
- Manages entity creation and destruction
- Handles frame-by-frame updates for all entities
- Integrates physics and rendering for all entities
- Supports collision detection between entities
- Enables efficient entity management and iteration
- Provides networking foundation for multiplayer
