# I/O System Analysis

## Purpose
The I/O system handles all input/output operations, including keyboard, mouse, and joystick input, as well as general file I/O operations.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `io_init()` - Initialize I/O system
- `io_poll()` - Poll for input events
- `io_key_add()` - Add keyboard event handlers
- `io_mouse_get_state()` - Get current mouse state
- File reading and writing functions

## Key Components
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard, mouse, and joystick support
- **Event Queue**: Buffered input event processing
- **State Tracking**: Current input device states
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing game data files
- **Configuration**: Input device configuration and mapping
- **Performance Timing**: High-resolution timing functions

## Dependencies
- Operating system input APIs
- Standard C/C++ file I/O
- Threading libraries for background operations

## Game Logic Integration
The I/O system enables player interaction:
- Processes all player input for game control
- Provides timing information for frame rate control
- Enables save/load functionality through file I/O
- Integrates with control configuration system
- Supports multiplayer through network I/O extensions
