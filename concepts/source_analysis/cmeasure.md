# Countermeasures System Analysis

## Purpose
The countermeasures system handles defensive systems that ships can deploy to avoid incoming weapons, including flares, chaff, and decoys.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `cmeasure_create()` - Create countermeasure instances
- `cmeasure_process()` - Update countermeasures each frame
- `cmeasure_select_next()` - Cycle through countermeasure types
- `ship_launch_countermeasure()` - Launch countermeasure from ship

## Key Components
- **Countermeasure Types**: Different defensive mechanisms
- **Deployment Logic**: When and how countermeasures are used
- **Effectiveness System**: How well countermeasures work against threats
- **AI Integration**: Automated countermeasure usage
- **Resource Management**: Countermeasure inventory and replenishment

## Dependencies
- `weapon.h` - Countermeasures as special weapon types
- `ship.h` - Ship countermeasure systems and deployment
- `ai.h` - AI countermeasure usage logic
- `object.h` - Countermeasures as object instances

## Game Logic Integration
The countermeasures system adds tactical depth:
- Provides defensive options against missile attacks
- Creates rock-paper-scissors gameplay with weapons
- Integrates with AI for realistic combat behavior
- Supports mission design with tactical considerations
- Balances gameplay through resource management
