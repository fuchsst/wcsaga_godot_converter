# Sound System Analysis

## Purpose
The sound system handles all audio playback, including sound effects, music, and voice communication. It manages audio resources and provides spatial audio for 3D positioning.

## Main Public Interfaces
- Sound loading and playback functions
- 3D spatial audio positioning
- Music playback and management
- Sound effect triggering and control
- Audio resource management

## Key Components
- **Sound Effects**: Weapon sounds, explosions, engine noises
- **Music System**: Background music and mission-specific tracks
- **Voice Acting**: Character dialogue and mission briefings
- **3D Audio**: Spatial positioning based on object locations
- **Audio Mixing**: Multiple simultaneous sound sources
- **Resource Management**: Loading, caching, and unloading audio
- **Environmental Effects**: Reverb and other audio processing

## Dependencies
- `object.h` - 3D positioning of audio sources
- `ship.h` - Ship-specific audio (engines, weapons)
- `weapon.h` - Weapon firing sounds
- `mission.h` - Mission-specific audio triggers

## Game Logic Integration
The sound system enhances the gameplay experience:
- Provides immersive audio feedback for actions
- Implements positional audio for tactical awareness
- Supports dynamic music that responds to gameplay
- Delivers voice acting for story and characters
- Manages audio performance and resource usage
