# Network/Multiplayer System Analysis

## Purpose
The network system handles all multiplayer functionality, including game hosting, joining, synchronization, and network communication between players.

## Main Public Interfaces
- Network game initialization and setup
- Player connection and disconnection handling
- Object synchronization across network
- Chat and communication systems
- Mission and game state synchronization

## Key Components
- **Connection Management**: Player joining/leaving and connection state
- **Object Synchronization**: Keeping game objects consistent across clients
- **Chat System**: Text communication between players
- **Game State Sync**: Mission progress, objectives, and events
- **Voice Communication**: Audio chat (if implemented)
- **Security**: Cheat prevention and data validation
- **Lobby System**: Game setup and player matching
- **Statistics**: Multiplayer scoring and ranking

## Dependencies
- `object.h` - Network synchronization of game objects
- `ship.h` - Ship state synchronization
- `weapon.h` - Weapon synchronization
- `mission.h` - Mission state synchronization
- `playerman.h` - Player state management

## Game Logic Integration
The network system enables multiplayer gameplay:
- Allows multiple players to participate in the same mission
- Synchronizes game state across all participants
- Handles player communication and coordination
- Implements competitive and cooperative gameplay modes
- Manages game hosting and client connections
- Provides anti-cheat mechanisms
