# Nebula System Analysis

## Purpose
The nebula system handles nebula rendering, properties, and effects. It provides atmospheric environmental effects that can impact gameplay through visibility and sensor limitations.

## Main Public Interfaces
- Nebula initialization and setup
- Nebula rendering and visual effects
- Sensor limitations and visibility effects
- Lightning and electrical effects

## Key Components
- **Nebula Rendering**: Volumetric or textured nebula visuals
- **Visibility System**: Reduced visibility in nebula fields
- **Sensor Limitations**: Restricted targeting and radar
- **Lightning Effects**: Electrical discharges and visual effects
- **Environmental Properties**: Density, color, and behavior

## Dependencies
- `graphics.h` - Rendering functions
- `ship.h` - Ship sensor and visibility limitations
- `hud.h` - HUD modifications in nebula
- `object.h` - Object visibility calculations

## Game Logic Integration
The nebula system adds tactical gameplay elements:
- Creates environmental challenges through reduced visibility
- Impacts sensor and targeting systems
- Adds atmospheric visual variety to missions
- Provides natural cover for tactical positioning
- Supports mission-specific environmental storytelling
