# Asteroid System Analysis

## Purpose
The asteroid system handles asteroid field generation, rendering, and interactions. It provides environmental hazards and visual elements for missions.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `asteroid_create()` - Creates asteroid instances
- `asteroid_process()` - Updates asteroids each frame
- `asteroid_hit()` - Handles asteroid damage and destruction
- `asteroid_init()` - Initializes asteroid system
- `asteroid_level_init()` - Initializes asteroids for each level

## Key Components
- **Asteroid Generation**: Procedural placement in mission space
- **Asteroid Types**: Different visual models and properties
- **Damage Modeling**: Hull damage when ships collide
- **Debris Creation**: Breaking apart into smaller pieces
- **Field Management**: Managing asteroid density and distribution
- **Collision Detection**: Interaction with ships and weapons

## Dependencies
- `object.h` - Asteroids are object instances
- `model.h` - Asteroid visual models
- `physics.h` - Asteroid movement and physics
- `ship.h` - Ship-asteroid interactions

## Game Logic Integration
The asteroid system adds environmental gameplay elements:
- Provides natural hazards in space combat
- Creates visual variety in mission environments
- Adds tactical considerations for navigation
- Supports mission objectives involving asteroids
- Integrates with damage system for ship collisions
