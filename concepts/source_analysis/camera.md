# Camera System Analysis

## Purpose
The camera system handles all view management, including player view, cinematic cameras, and different camera modes for various gameplay situations.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `cam_init()` - Initialize camera system
- `cam_set_camera()` - Set current camera
- `cam_update()` - Update camera position and orientation
- Camera mode switching functions
- View matrix calculation functions

## Key Components
- **View Management**: Different camera perspectives
- **Camera Modes**: First-person, third-person, external views
- **Cinematic Cameras**: Scripted camera movements
- **Smooth Transitions**: Interpolation between camera positions
- **Input Integration**: Control mapping to camera movement
- **Collision Detection**: Preventing camera clipping

## Dependencies
- `object.h` - Object positioning and orientation
- `physics.h` - Movement and positioning
- `graphics.h` - View matrix and rendering
- `ship.h` - Ship-specific camera positions

## Game Logic Integration
The camera system provides flexible viewpoint options:
- Enables different perspectives for gameplay and cinematics
- Integrates with autopilot for cinematic sequences
- Supports multiplayer with different player views
- Provides technical views for debugging and development
- Enables modding through configurable camera behaviors
