# IFF Definitions System Analysis

## Purpose
The IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) system handles faction relationships, colors, and identification mechanics for different teams and species in the game.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `iff_info` - Structure defining IFF properties
- `iff_info_lookup()` - Find IFF by name
- `iff_init()` - Initialize IFF system
- IFF relationship query functions

## Key Components
- **Faction Definitions**: Team names, colors, and properties
- **Relationship Matrix**: Alliance, neutral, and enemy relationships
- **Color Coding**: Visual identification through HUD colors
- **Squadron Assignments**: Grouping of ships by IFF
- **Tactical Behavior**: How different IFFs interact

## Dependencies
- `ship.h` - Ship IFF assignments
- `hud.h` - HUD color coding
- `ai.h` - AI targeting based on IFF relationships
- `species_defs.h` - Species integration with IFF

## Game Logic Integration
The IFF system enables complex faction gameplay:
- Defines team relationships and alliances
- Provides visual identification of friend/foe
- Integrates with AI for tactical targeting decisions
- Supports multiplayer team-based gameplay
- Enables mission design with complex diplomatic scenarios
