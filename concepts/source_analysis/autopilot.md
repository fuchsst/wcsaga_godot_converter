# Autopilot System Analysis

## Purpose
The autopilot system handles automated navigation and flight control, allowing ships to follow predetermined paths without player input.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `autopilot_init()` - Initialize autopilot system
- `autopilot_process()` - Update autopilot each frame
- `autopilot_engage()` - Engage autopilot for a ship
- `autopilot_disengage()` - Disengage autopilot

## Key Components
- **Path Following**: Navigation along waypoints or paths
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Detection and avoidance of obstacles
- **Formation Flying**: Coordinated movement with other ships
- **Navigation Logic**: Route calculation and optimization
- **Control Systems**: Automated control input generation

## Dependencies
- `ship.h` - Ship movement and control
- `physics.h` - Physics simulation and control
- `ai.h` - AI pathfinding and navigation
- `object.h` - Object positioning and movement

## Game Logic Integration
The autopilot system provides navigation assistance:
- Enables long-distance travel without player input
- Supports mission scripting with automated ship movements
- Integrates with AI for coordinated fleet operations
- Provides cinematic camera movement capabilities
- Supports multiplayer convoy and formation flying
