# Bitmap Manager System Analysis

## Purpose
The bitmap manager system handles all bitmap and texture loading, management, caching, and memory optimization for the game's graphics rendering.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `bm_load()` - Load bitmap files
- `bm_create()` - Create bitmap instances
- `bm_release()` - Release bitmap resources
- `bm_get_info()` - Get bitmap information
- Bitmap caching and memory management functions

## Key Components
- **Texture Loading**: Support for various image formats
- **Memory Management**: Efficient allocation and deallocation
- **Caching System**: Keeping frequently used bitmaps in memory
- **Format Conversion**: Converting between different bitmap formats
- **Compression Support**: Handling compressed texture formats
- **Streaming**: Loading bitmaps on-demand for large datasets

## Dependencies
- Graphics API (OpenGL/DirectX)
- File I/O systems
- Memory management utilities
- Image format libraries

## Game Logic Integration
The bitmap manager system enables efficient graphics rendering:
- Provides centralized management of all game textures
- Optimizes memory usage through intelligent caching
- Supports various image formats for modding flexibility
- Integrates with model and UI systems for texture application
- Enables performance optimization through streaming and compression
