# Game Sequence System Analysis

## Purpose
The game sequence system manages the overall game state and event flow, controlling transitions between different game modes such as menus, briefing, gameplay, and debriefing.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `gameseq_init()` - Initializes the game sequence system
- `gameseq_process_events()` - Processes pending events and updates state
- `gameseq_post_event()` - Posts an event for processing
- `gameseq_set_state()` - Changes the current game state
- `gameseq_get_state()` - Gets the current game state
- `game_enter_state()` - Called when entering a new state
- `game_leave_state()` - Called when leaving a state
- `game_do_state()` - Called each frame to process current state

## Key Components
- **Game States**: Main menu, gameplay, briefing, debriefing, etc.
- **Game Events**: Triggers for state transitions
- **State Stack**: Push/pop mechanism for nested states
- **Event Queue**: Pending events awaiting processing
- **State Callbacks**: Entry, exit, and processing functions for each state

## Dependencies
- All major game systems as states interact with their respective systems

## Game Logic Integration
The game sequence system orchestrates the entire game flow:
- Controls transitions between menus and gameplay
- Manages mission flow from briefing to debriefing
- Handles pause/unpause functionality
- Integrates all UI screens and game modes
- Manages campaign progression
- Controls multiplayer game flow
- Provides foundation for modding through scripting hooks
