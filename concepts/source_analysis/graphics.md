# Graphics System Analysis

## Purpose
The graphics system handles all rendering functionality, including 2D and 3D rendering, textures, lighting, and visual effects.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `gr_*` functions for rendering primitives
- Texture loading and management
- 3D rendering pipeline
- Lighting and shading systems
- Special effects rendering

## Key Components
- **2D Rendering**: UI elements, HUD, and 2D graphics
- **3D Rendering**: Model rendering with lighting and shading
- **Texture Management**: Loading, caching, and applying textures
- **Lighting System**: Dynamic and static lighting
- **Particle Effects**: Explosions, engine trails, and other effects
- **Post-Processing**: Screen effects and filters
- **Render States**: Managing graphics pipeline states

## Dependencies
- `model.h` - 3D model rendering
- `2d.h` - 2D graphics primitives
- `bmpman.h` - Bitmap management
- `lighting.h` - Lighting calculations

## Game Logic Integration
The graphics system provides the visual presentation:
- Renders all game objects and environments
- Implements visual effects for weapons and explosions
- Provides rendering performance optimization
- Supports different graphics settings and quality levels
- Integrates with HUD for information display
