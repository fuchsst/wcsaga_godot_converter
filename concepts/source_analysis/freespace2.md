# Freespace2 Main System Analysis

## Purpose
The freespace2 system contains the main game executable code, including initialization, main loop, and high-level game management functions.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `game_init()` - Game initialization
- `game_main()` - Main game loop
- `game_shutdown()` - Game cleanup and shutdown
- State management and game flow control
- Platform-specific integration points

## Key Components
- **Main Loop**: Primary game execution cycle
- **Initialization**: System setup and resource loading
- **Shutdown**: Cleanup and resource deallocation
- **State Management**: High-level game state coordination
- **Platform Integration**: OS-specific functionality
- **Error Handling**: Crash recovery and error reporting

## Dependencies
- All major game systems
- Platform-specific libraries and APIs
- Configuration and settings systems

## Game Logic Integration
The freespace2 system orchestrates the entire game:
- Serves as the entry point and main execution context
- Manages the relationship between all subsystems
- Handles platform-specific integration requirements
- Provides error handling and crash recovery
- Controls overall game lifecycle from start to exit
