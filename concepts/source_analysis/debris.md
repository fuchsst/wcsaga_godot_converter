# Debris System Analysis

## Purpose
The debris system handles the creation, management, and rendering of debris pieces from destroyed ships and asteroids. It provides visual feedback for destruction and adds to the chaos of combat.

## Main Public Interfaces
- `debris_create()` - Creates debris instances
- `debris_process()` - Updates debris each frame
- `debris_init()` - Initializes debris system
- `debris_level_init()` - Initializes debris for each level

## Key Components
- **Debris Generation**: Creating pieces from destroyed objects
- **Physics Simulation**: Movement and rotation of debris pieces
- **Lifetime Management**: Automatic removal after time expires
- **Visual Effects**: Rendering with appropriate models/textures
- **Collision Detection**: Interaction with other objects
- **Damage Application**: Debris can damage other ships

## Dependencies
- `object.h` - Debris are object instances
- `model.h` - Debris visual models
- `physics.h` - Debris movement and physics
- `ship.h` - Ship destruction generates debris

## Game Logic Integration
The debris system enhances combat realism:
- Provides visual feedback for ship destruction
- Adds tactical elements as debris can damage ships
- Creates dynamic battlefield environment
- Supports performance through automatic cleanup
- Integrates with particle effects for explosions
