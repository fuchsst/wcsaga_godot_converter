### Implementation Approach
The conversion follows these principles aligned with our Godot project architecture:

1. **Preserve Gameplay Logic**: Maintain core gameplay mechanics and balance
2. **Replace Engine Systems**: Use Godot equivalents for low-level systems
3. **Data-Driven Design**: Leverage Godot resources for configuration with feature-based organization
4. **Modular Architecture**: Maintain system separation and clear interfaces following feature-based principles
5. **Performance Optimization**: Utilize Godot's built-in optimizations
6. **Extensibility**: Enable easy modding and customization through self-contained feature directories
7. **Scalability**: Follow the hybrid model with feature-based organization as default and global assets in `/assets/`

## Integration Strategy

### System Relationships
We documented the complex relationships between all modules, organized according to our directory structure:

```
Core Entity (features/) → Object → Ship/Weapon/AI/Mission/etc.
Physics (scripts/physics/) → All movable entities
Model/Graphics (integrated with features/) → Visual presentation
Sound/Audio (autoload/ + assets/audio/) → Auditory feedback
UI/HUD (features/ui/) → Player interface
Mission (campaigns/ + autoload/mission_manager.gd) → Game flow orchestration
AI (scripts/ai/) → Tactical behavior
Parse (replaced by Godot resources) → Configuration loading
```

### Conversion Phases
1. **Foundation**: Core entity and physics systems (`/features/`, `/scripts/physics/`)
2. **Gameplay**: Ships, weapons, and AI (`/features/fighters/`, `/features/weapons/`, `/scripts/ai/`)
3. **Mission Flow**: Mission parsing and game state management (`/campaigns/`, `/autoload/`)
4. **UI**: Interface and HUD systems (`/features/ui/`)
5. **Enhancement**: Visual/audio effects and polish (`/features/effects/`, `/assets/`)
6. **Content**: Mission and campaign conversion (`/campaigns/`)
7. **Testing**: Validation and optimization
