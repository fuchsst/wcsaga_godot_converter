## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Issues**: Regular profiling and optimization throughout development
2. **Physics Differences**: Extensive testing to ensure faithful replication
3. **AI Behavior**: Validation against original gameplay for consistency
4. **Asset Conversion**: Dedicated time for asset pipeline development
5. **Compatibility**: Testing on multiple platforms and hardware configurations

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features for initial release
2. **Asset Conversion Delays**: Parallel asset conversion with development
3. **Testing Time**: Include testing in each phase rather than at end
4. **Bug Fixing**: Reserve adequate time for bug fixing and polish

### Quality Risks
1. **Game Feel**: Preserve core gameplay mechanics and controls
2. **Balance**: Maintain weapon and ship balance from original
3. **Visuals**: Ensure visual quality meets expectations
4. **Audio**: Preserve audio atmosphere and immersion
