- `module_relationships.md` - System dependencies and integration points
- `final_summary.md` - Comprehensive system overview

## Godot Implementation Approach
All documentation follows Godot's recommended best practices:

1. **Feature-Based Organization**: Modules are organized by game feature rather than by asset type, with all files related to a single conceptual unit grouped together in a self-contained directory.

2. **Data-Driven Design**: Game-defining statistics are stored in external .tres files using Godot's Resource system, enabling rapid iteration and community modding.

3. **Idiomatic Godot Patterns**: Implementation leverages engine-native solutions like node-based Finite State Machines, Signal/Event Bus patterns, and MultiMeshInstance3D for performance.

## Usage
These documents provide a roadmap for converting the Wing Commander Saga codebase to Godot while preserving gameplay functionality and extending it with modern engine capabilities. Each module document includes:

1. Purpose and scope
2. Public interfaces and components
3. Dependencies on other systems
4. Godot equivalent implementations
5. Integration considerations

## Next Steps
1. Review individual module documentation to understand system requirements
2. Examine the feature-based directory structure in `directory_structure.md`
3. Begin implementation of core systems in Godot following the integration plan
4. Follow the conversion roadmap for systematic development
5. Test and refine implementation against original gameplay
6. Optimize and extend with Godot-specific features
