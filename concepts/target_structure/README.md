## Godot Implementation Approach
All documentation follows Godot's recommended best practices as defined in `Godot_Project_Structure_Refinement.md`:

1. **Feature-Based Organization**: Modules are organized by game feature rather than by asset type, with all files related to a single conceptual unit grouped together in a self-contained directory within `/features/`. This approach treats each feature folder as a self-contained module or component, aligning perfectly with Godot's design philosophy.

2. **Hybrid Asset Organization**: This structure follows a hybrid model where truly global, context-agnostic assets are organized in `/assets/`, while semi-global assets shared by a specific category of features use `/_shared/` directories within their parent category. The guiding principle is: "If I delete three random features, is this asset still needed?" If yes, it belongs in `/assets/`; if only needed by a specific feature category, it belongs in that category's `/_shared/` directory.

3. **Data-Driven Design**: Game-defining statistics are stored in external .tres files using Godot's Resource system, enabling rapid iteration and community modding. Configuration data is organized in `/assets/` while mission-specific data is stored with missions in `/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/{mission_id}_{mission_name}/`.

4. **Idiomatic Godot Patterns**: Implementation leverages engine-native solutions like node-based Finite State Machines, Signal/Event Bus patterns, and MultiMeshInstance3D for performance. Reusable code is organized in `/scripts/` while global singletons reside in `/autoload/`.

## Directory Structure Implementation
Following the feature-based organization principles defined in `directory_structure.md`, the Godot project will be structured as follows:

### Root Directory Structure
```
wcsaga_godot/
├── addons/                # Third-party plugins and extensions
├── assets/                # Global asset library (truly shared assets)
├── autoload/              # Singleton scripts (auto-loaded)
├── campaigns/             # Campaign data and mission scenes
├── features/              # Self-contained game features organized by category
├── scripts/               # Reusable GDScript code and custom resources
├── project.godot          # Godot project file
└── README.md             # Project README
```

### Feature Organization
Game features are organized within `/features/` by category:
- `/features/fighters/` - Fighter ship entities
- `/features/capital_ships/` - Capital ship entities
- `/features/weapons/` - Weapon systems and projectiles
- `/features/effects/` - Visual and audio effects
- `/features/environment/` - Environmental objects and props
- `/features/ui/` - User interface elements

Each feature is a self-contained directory with all related assets, scripts, and data.

### Script Organization
Reusable code is organized in `/scripts/` by functionality:
- `/scripts/entities/` - Base entity scripts
- `/scripts/ai/` - AI behavior scripts
- `/scripts/mission/` - Mission system scripts
- `/scripts/physics/` - Physics system scripts
- `/scripts/audio/` - Audio system scripts
- `/scripts/utilities/` - Utility functions and helpers

### Asset Organization
Assets are organized using a hybrid approach:
- `/assets/` - Truly global, context-agnostic assets
- `/features/{category}/_shared/` - Semi-global assets shared by a specific category of features

### Campaign Organization
Campaign data is organized in `/campaigns/` with all mission data stored together:
- `/campaigns/{campaign_name}/missions/{mission_id}_{mission_name}/` - Mission-specific data and scenes

## Usage
These documents provide a roadmap for converting the Wing Commander Saga codebase to Godot while preserving gameplay functionality and extending it with modern engine capabilities. Each module document includes:

1. Purpose and scope
2. Public interfaces and components
3. Dependencies on other systems
4. Godot equivalent implementations
5. Integration considerations

## Next Steps
1. Review individual module documentation to understand system requirements
2. Examine the feature-based directory structure in `directory_structure.md`
3. Begin implementation of core systems in Godot following the integration plan
4. Follow the conversion roadmap for systematic development
5. Test and refine implementation against original gameplay
6. Optimize and extend with Godot-specific features
