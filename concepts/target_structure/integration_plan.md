# Wing Commander Saga to Godot Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the integration plan for converting Wing Commander Saga from its original C++ engine to the Godot engine. The conversion focuses on preserving gameplay while leveraging Godot's modern features and architecture, following a feature-based organizational approach as recommended by Godot best practices and the hybrid model defined in our project structure.

## Conversion Approach
The conversion will follow a hybrid approach that preserves core gameplay logic while replacing low-level systems with Godot equivalents:

### Systems to Preserve Logic From
1. **Physics System** - Core movement and collision logic
2. **AI System** - Combat tactics and navigation behaviors
3. **Weapon System** - Damage calculations and special effects
4. **Mission System** - Event triggers and objective management
5. **Ship System** - Damage modeling and subsystem behaviors
6. **Game State System** - State management and flow control

### Systems to Replace with Godot Equivalents
1. **Graphics System** - Replace with Godot's renderer
2. **Audio System** - Replace with Godot's audio engine
3. **Input System** - Replace with Godot's input handling
4. **UI System** - Replace with Godot's UI framework
5. **Object System** - Replace with Godot's node system
6. **Math Library** - Replace with Godot's math functions
7. **File I/O** - Replace with Godot's resource system
8. **Memory Management** - Replace with Godot's memory management

## Module Conversion Strategy

### 1. Autoload System (/autoload/)
Implement global singleton systems using Godot's autoload system, following the "Is this state or service truly global and required everywhere?" principle:
- Game state management singleton (`/autoload/game_state.gd`)
- Event bus for decoupled communication between systems (`/autoload/event_bus.gd`)
- Resource loading utilities for data-driven design (`/autoload/resource_loader.gd`)
- Audio manager for sound effects and music (`/autoload/audio_manager.gd`)
- Save/load system for player progression (`/autoload/save_manager.gd`)

### 2. Data System (/assets/)
Convert all configuration data to Godot resources following the "Global Litmus Test": "If I delete three random features, is this asset still needed?":
- Ship definitions to ShipData resources in `/assets/data/ships/`
- Weapon definitions to WeaponData resources in `/assets/data/weapons/`
- AI profiles to AIProfile resources in `/assets/data/ai/`
- Species and IFF relationship definitions in `/assets/data/species/` and `/assets/data/iff/`
- Armor type damage modifiers in `/assets/data/armor/`
- Effect system parameters in `/assets/data/effects/`
- Generic UI sounds in `/assets/audio/ui/`
- Generic particle textures in `/assets/textures/effects/`
- Global fonts in `/assets/textures/fonts/`
- Use Godot's resource system for data-driven design with centralized management

### 3. Feature System (/features/)
Convert game objects to feature-based Godot scenes organized by category, following the co-location principle where all files related to a single feature are grouped together:

#### Fighter Features
- Fighters as self-contained scenes in `/features/fighters/{faction}_{ship_name}/` with model, components, scripts, and specific assets
- Shared cockpit models in `/features/fighters/_shared/cockpits/`
- Shared effects in `/features/fighters/_shared/effects/`

#### Capital Ship Features
- Capital ships as self-contained scenes in `/features/capital_ships/{faction}_{ship_name}/`
- Shared bridge components in `/features/capital_ships/_shared/bridge_models/`
- Shared turret models in `/features/capital_ships/_shared/turret_models/`

#### Weapon Features
- Weapons as reusable scenes in `/features/weapons/{weapon_name}/` with effects and behavior
- Projectiles using Godot physics for movement in `/features/weapons/projectiles/{projectile_name}/`
- Shared muzzle flashes in `/features/weapons/_shared/muzzle_flashes/`
- Shared impact effects in `/features/weapons/_shared/impact_effects/`

#### Effect Features
- Effects using particle systems and shaders in `/features/effects/{effect_name}/`
- Shared particle textures in `/features/effects/_shared/particle_textures/`
- Shared shader effects in `/features/effects/_shared/shader_effects/`

#### Environment Features
- Environmental objects organized by type in `/features/environment/{prop_name}/`
- Shared space debris in `/features/environment/_shared/debris/`
- Shared environmental textures in `/features/environment/_shared/environment/`

#### UI Features
- UI components organized by function in `/features/ui/{component_name}/` following the same self-contained approach:
  - Main menu in `/features/ui/main_menu/`
  - HUD in `/features/ui/hud/`
  - Briefing in `/features/ui/briefing/`
  - Debriefing in `/features/ui/debriefing/`
  - Options in `/features/ui/options/`
  - Tech database in `/features/ui/tech_database/`
- Shared UI assets in `/features/ui/_shared/`:
  - Fonts in `/features/ui/_shared/fonts/`
  - Icons in `/features/ui/_shared/icons/`
  - Themes in `/features/ui/_shared/themes/`
  - Reusable components in `/features/ui/_shared/components/`

### 4. Campaign System (/campaigns/)
Organize mission content and narrative progression following the campaign-centric mission organization:
- Missions organized by campaign in `/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/{mission_id}_{mission_name}/`
- Mission scenes with integrated entity instances
- Fiction and briefing text integrated with missions
- Campaign progression tracking and player data in `/campaigns/{campaign}/`

### 5. Script System (/scripts/)
Implement reusable game logic and base classes, following the separation of concerns principle where nothing in this folder should be a complete, instantiable game object:
- Base entity scripts for fighters, capital ships, weapons, and effects in `/scripts/entities/`
- AI behavior scripts for decision-making and tactics in `/scripts/ai/`
- Mission system scripts for event handling and objective tracking in `/scripts/mission/`
- Physics system scripts for space-specific behaviors in `/scripts/physics/`
- Audio system scripts for sound management in `/scripts/audio/`
- Utility scripts for common functionality in `/scripts/utilities/`

## Data Conversion Strategy
