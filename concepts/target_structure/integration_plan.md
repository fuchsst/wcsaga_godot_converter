# Wing Commander Saga to Godot Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the integration plan for converting Wing Commander Saga from its original C++ engine to the Godot engine. The conversion focuses on preserving gameplay while leveraging Godot's modern features and architecture, following a feature-based organizational approach as recommended by Godot best practices.

## Conversion Approach
The conversion will follow a hybrid approach that preserves core gameplay logic while replacing low-level systems with Godot equivalents:

### Systems to Preserve Logic From
1. **Physics System** - Core movement and collision logic
2. **AI System** - Combat tactics and navigation behaviors
3. **Weapon System** - Damage calculations and special effects
4. **Mission System** - Event triggers and objective management
5. **Ship System** - Damage modeling and subsystem behaviors
6. **Game State System** - State management and flow control

### Systems to Replace with Godot Equivalents
1. **Graphics System** - Replace with Godot's renderer
2. **Audio System** - Replace with Godot's audio engine
3. **Input System** - Replace with Godot's input handling
4. **UI System** - Replace with Godot's UI framework
5. **Object System** - Replace with Godot's node system
6. **Math Library** - Replace with Godot's math functions
7. **File I/O** - Replace with Godot's resource system
8. **Memory Management** - Replace with Godot's memory management

## Module Conversion Strategy

### 1. Core Systems (/core/)
Implement engine-agnostic core logic using Godot's built-in systems:
- State machine base class for AI and game flow
- Event bus for decoupled communication between systems
- Resource loading utilities for data-driven design
- Generic object pooling system for efficient memory management

### 2. Data System (/data/)
Convert all configuration data to Godot resources following feature-based organization:
- Ship definitions to ShipData resources organized by faction and type
- Weapon definitions to WeaponData resources organized by faction and type
- AI profiles to AIProfile resources organized by behavior type
- Mission data to MissionData resources organized by campaign
- Use Godot's resource system for data-driven design with Flyweight pattern benefits

### 3. Entity System (/entities/)
Convert game objects to feature-based Godot scenes:
- Ships as self-contained scenes with model, components, and scripts in dedicated folders
- Weapons as reusable scenes with effects and behavior
- Projectiles using Godot physics for movement
- Effects using particle systems and shaders
- Environmental objects organized by type

### 4. Systems Logic (/systems/)
Implement game logic using Godot's node-based architecture:
- AI decision-making using behavior trees and state machines
- Mission control with event triggers and objective management
- Weapon control with damage calculations and special effects
- Physics integration with custom space-specific behaviors
- Audio system with 3D positioning and effects

### 5. UI System (/ui/)
Replace with Godot's UI system using feature-based organization:
- UI screens as self-contained scenes organized by function
- HUD elements as canvas layers with modular components
- Menus using Godot's control nodes with consistent theming
- Preserve layout and visual design while leveraging Godot's flexibility

## Data Conversion Strategy

### Configuration Files (.tbl)
Convert to Godot resources (.tres) organized by feature:
- Ship definitions to ShipData resources in `/data/ships/{faction}/{type}/`
- Weapon definitions to WeaponData resources in `/data/weapons/{faction}/`
- AI profiles to AIProfile resources in `/data/ai/profiles/`
- Mission data to MissionData resources in `/data/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/`
- Use Godot's resource system for data-driven design with centralized management

### Mission Files (.fs2)
Convert to Godot scenes (.tscn) organized by feature:
- Missions as complete scenes with all entities in `/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/{mission_name}/`
- Events as timeline sequences using Godot's animation system
- Objectives as MissionObjective resources
- Use Godot's scene system for composition with modular encounter templates

### Fiction Files (.txt)
Convert to Godot text resources with formatting:
- Narrative content as formatted text resources
- Preserve formatting with BBCode for rich text display
- Use Godot's RichTextLabel for presentation

### Campaign Files (.fc2)
Convert to campaign management system:
- Mission sequencing using Godot's resource system in `/campaigns/{campaign_name}/`
- Player progression using save games with persistent data
- Use Godot's save system for cross-platform persistence

## Asset Conversion Pipeline

### 3D Models (.pof)
Convert to Godot-compatible formats:
- POF to glTF conversion tool preserving model hierarchy
- Maintain subobject structure and animation points
- Convert textures to Godot-supported formats (WebP)
- Preserve effect points for thrusters, weapons, and subsystems

### Textures
Convert to Godot-supported formats:
- PCX/PNG to WebP conversion with quality preservation
- Maintain mipmaps and compression for performance
- Convert normal maps to Godot format
- Preserve texture atlases for UI elements

### Audio
Convert to Godot-supported formats:
- WAV/OGG to OGG conversion maintaining audio quality
- Preserve metadata and audio characteristics
- Organize by type (SFX, music, voice) in feature-based folders
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for easy asset linking

### Fonts
Convert to Godot font resources:
- Vector fonts to Godot font resources with proper kerning
- Support multiple resolutions with scalable font sizes
- Maintain Unicode support for international characters
- Create theme resources for consistent UI appearance
