# Mission Module (Godot Implementation)

## Purpose
The Mission Module handles all mission-related data, parsing, loading, and execution in the Godot implementation. It manages mission objectives, events, ships, wings, and the overall mission flow from briefing to debriefing, while leveraging Godot's scene-based architecture and resource system.

## Components
- **Mission System**: Core mission functionality and management
- **Mission Parser**: Reads mission files and creates game entities
- **Mission Classes**: Mission templates defining properties and flow
- **Mission Events**: Scripted events and triggers based on conditions
- **Mission Objectives**: Primary, secondary, and bonus objectives
- **Wing Management**: Grouped ships with coordinated behavior
- **Reinforcements**: Dynamic ship arrival system
- **Support Ships**: Repair/rearm functionality
- **Mission Flow**: State management from briefing to debriefing
- **Cutscene System**: Video and real-time cutscene integration
- **Fiction Viewer**: Narrative text presentation system
- **Briefing/Debriefing**: Mission introduction and evaluation screens

## Dependencies
- **Core Entity Module**: Missions create and manage game objects
- **Ship Module**: Missions define ship properties and behaviors
- **Weapon Module**: Missions specify weapon loadouts
- **AI Module**: Missions set AI directives and goals
- **Game State Module**: Missions integrate with game state management
- **UI Module**: Mission briefing/debriefing interfaces
- **Audio Module**: Mission-specific audio triggers
- **Visual Effects Module**: Mission visual effects and cutscenes

## Implementation Notes
The Mission Module in Godot leverages:

1. **Resource System**: Missions as data-driven configurations using Godot resources
2. **Scene System**: Missions as scenes with environment and entities
3. **Signals**: Event-driven mission flow and objective tracking
4. **Node Hierarchy**: Mission entities as nodes in the scene tree
5. **Autoload**: MissionManager as a global singleton for mission state
6. **Condition/Action Pattern**: Events using condition/action design pattern
7. **Campaign System**: Campaign progression through linked missions
8. **Narrative Integration**: Fiction viewer for story content

This replaces the C++ file parsing system with Godot's resource system while preserving the same mission structure and gameplay functionality. The event system is implemented using Godot's built-in signal system for better integration with the engine.

The implementation uses Godot's scene system for mission environments and the resource system for mission definitions, making it easy to manage and modify missions. The campaign system handles mission sequencing and player progression through a data-driven approach.

The briefing/debriefing systems use Godot's UI system for presentation, and the fiction viewer handles narrative content display. Cutscenes can be implemented as either video playback or real-time sequences using Godot's animation system.

The mission manager handles the overall mission flow, including entity management, objective tracking, and event processing. It integrates with all other game systems to orchestrate the complete mission experience while preserving the core gameplay functionality of the original FreeSpace engine.
