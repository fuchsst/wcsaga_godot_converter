# Mission Module (Godot Implementation)

## Purpose
The Mission Module handles all mission-related data, parsing, loading, and execution in the Godot implementation. It manages mission objectives, events, ships, wings, and the overall mission flow from briefing to debriefing, while leveraging Godot's scene-based architecture and resource system. The implementation follows the feature-based organizational approach and hybrid model defined in our project structure.

## Components
- **Mission System**: Core mission functionality and management
- **Mission Parser**: Reads mission files and creates game entities
- **Mission Classes**: Mission templates defining properties and flow
- **Mission Events**: Scripted events and triggers based on conditions
- **Mission Objectives**: Primary, secondary, and bonus objectives
- **Wing Management**: Grouped ships with coordinated behavior
- **Reinforcements**: Dynamic ship arrival system
- **Support Ships**: Repair/rearm functionality
- **Mission Flow**: State management from briefing to debriefing
- **Cutscene System**: Video and real-time cutscene integration
- **Fiction Viewer**: Narrative text presentation system
- **Briefing/Debriefing**: Mission introduction and evaluation screens

## Dependencies
- **Core Entity Module**: Missions create and manage game objects
- **Ship Module**: Missions define ship properties and behaviors
- **Weapon Module**: Missions specify weapon loadouts
- **AI Module**: Missions set AI directives and goals
- **Game State Module**: Missions integrate with game state management
- **UI Module**: Mission briefing/debriefing interfaces
- **Audio Module**: Mission-specific audio triggers
- **Visual Effects Module**: Mission visual effects and cutscenes

## Implementation Notes
The Mission Module in Godot leverages:

1. **Resource System**: Missions as data-driven configurations using Godot resources
2. **Scene System**: Missions as scenes with environment and entities
3. **Signals**: Event-driven mission flow and objective tracking
4. **Node Hierarchy**: Mission entities as nodes in the scene tree
5. **Autoload**: MissionManager as a global singleton for mission state
6. **Condition/Action Pattern**: Events using condition/action design pattern
7. **Campaign System**: Campaign progression through linked missions
8. **Narrative Integration**: Fiction viewer for story content

This replaces the C++ file parsing system with Godot's resource system while preserving the same mission structure and gameplay functionality. The event system is implemented using Godot's built-in signal system for better integration with the engine.

The implementation uses Godot's scene system for mission environments and the resource system for mission definitions, making it easy to manage and modify missions. The campaign system handles mission sequencing and player progression through a data-driven approach.

The briefing/debriefing systems use Godot's UI system for presentation, and the fiction viewer handles narrative content display. Cutscenes can be implemented as either video playback or real-time sequences using Godot's animation system.

The mission manager handles the overall mission flow, including entity management, objective tracking, and event processing. It integrates with all other game systems to orchestrate the complete mission experience while preserving the core gameplay functionality of the original FreeSpace engine.

## Directory Structure Implementation

Following the feature-based organization principles and the "campaign-centric mission organization" approach, mission-related components are organized as follows:

### Autoload System (`/autoload/`)
Following the "Is this state or service truly global and required everywhere?" principle:
- `mission_manager.gd` - Global singleton for mission state management and orchestration (`/autoload/mission_manager.gd`)

### Campaign System (`/campaigns/`)
Missions are organized by campaign in the `/campaigns/` directory with each campaign having its own subdirectory, following the campaign-centric mission organization principle where all mission data is stored with the mission scenes in campaign-specific directories:

- `/campaigns/hermes/` - Hermes campaign data and missions
- `/campaigns/brimstone/` - Brimstone campaign data and missions
- `/campaigns/training/` - Training campaign data and missions
- `/campaigns/multiplayer/` - Multiplayer campaign data

Each campaign directory contains:
- `campaign.tres` - Campaign definition resource (`/campaigns/{campaign}/campaign.tres`)
- `progression.tres` - Campaign progression data (`/campaigns/{campaign}/progression.tres`)
- `pilot_data.tres` - Pilot progression data (`/campaigns/{campaign}/pilot_data.tres`)
- `/missions/` - Directory containing individual mission data (`/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/`)

Each mission is organized in its own subdirectory following the self-contained feature organization principle:
- `/campaigns/hermes/missions/m01_hermes/` - Mission 1 for Hermes campaign
- `/campaigns/hermes/missions/m02_hermes/` - Mission 2 for Hermes campaign
- `/campaigns/brimstone/missions/m01_brimstone/` - Mission 1 for Brimstone campaign
- `/campaigns/brimstone/missions/m02_brimstone/` - Mission 2 for Brimstone campaign

Each mission directory contains all files related to that specific mission, following the co-location principle:
- `mission.tscn` - Main mission scene file (`/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/{mission_id}_{mission_name}/mission.tscn`)
- `mission_data.tres` - Mission configuration resource (`/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/{mission_id}_{mission_name}/mission_data.tres`)
- `briefing.txt` - Briefing text content (`/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/{mission_id}_{mission_name}/briefing.txt`)
- `fiction.txt` - Fiction text content (`/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/{mission_id}_{mission_name}/fiction.txt`)
- `objectives.tres` - Mission objectives resource (`/campaigns/{campaign}/missions/{mission_id}_{mission_name}/objectives.tres`)

### Feature System (`/features/`)
Mission-related UI components are organized in the `/features/ui/` directory as self-contained features, following the same feature-based approach where all files related to a specific UI component are grouped together:

- `/features/ui/briefing/` - Briefing interface with all related assets in a self-contained directory
  - `briefing_screen.tscn` - Main briefing scene
  - `briefing_screen.gd` - Briefing script
  - All briefing-specific assets (backgrounds, fonts, etc.)
- `/features/ui/debriefing/` - Debriefing interface with all related assets in a self-contained directory
  - `debriefing_screen.tscn` - Main debriefing scene
  - `debriefing_screen.gd` - Debriefing script
  - All debriefing-specific assets
- `/features/ui/tech_database/` - Technical database interface with all related assets in a self-contained directory (includes fiction viewer functionality)
  - `tech_database.tscn` - Main tech database scene
  - `tech_database.gd` - Tech database script
  - All tech database-specific assets

Shared UI assets that are truly global are organized in `/features/ui/_shared/`:
- `/features/ui/_shared/fonts/` - Shared UI fonts
- `/features/ui/_shared/icons/` - Shared UI icons
- `/features/ui/_shared/themes/` - Shared UI themes

### Script System (`/scripts/`)
Reusable mission system scripts are organized in the `/scripts/mission/` directory, following the separation of concerns principle where nothing in this folder should be a complete, instantiable game object:

- `/scripts/mission/mission_manager.gd` - Core mission management functionality
- `/scripts/mission/event_system.gd` - Mission event handling and triggers
- `/scripts/mission/objective_tracker.gd` - Objective tracking and completion
- `/scripts/mission/campaign_progression.gd` - Campaign progression logic
- `/scripts/mission/briefing_system.gd` - Briefing presentation logic
- `/scripts/mission/debriefing_system.gd` - Debriefing evaluation logic

This organization follows the feature-based approach where all files related to a specific feature are grouped together, making it easy to locate, modify, and maintain mission-related components while maintaining clear separation of concerns between different systems. The structure aligns with the hybrid model that combines the scalability and modularity of feature-based organization with a clean repository for generic, reusable assets.
