# Game State Module (Godot Implementation)

## Purpose
The Game State Module manages the overall game state and event flow in the Godot implementation, controlling transitions between different game modes such as menus, briefing, gameplay, and debriefing. It orchestrates the entire game flow from startup to shutdown while leveraging Godot's node-based architecture and scene system.

## Components
- **Game State Manager**: Central state management and event processing
- **Game States**: Main menu, gameplay, briefing, debriefing, etc.
- **Game Events**: Triggers for state transitions
- **State Stack**: Push/pop mechanism for nested states
- **Event Queue**: Pending events awaiting processing
- **Main Game Loop**: Primary game execution cycle
- **Initialization**: System setup and resource loading
- **Shutdown**: Cleanup and resource deallocation
- **Configuration Management**: Game settings and preferences
- **Save System**: Player progress and campaign state

## Dependencies
- **All Major Game Systems**: States interact with their respective systems
- **UI Module**: State transitions often involve UI changes
- **Mission Module**: Mission loading and execution
- **Player Module**: Player state management
- **Audio Module**: Music and sound state management
- **Graphics Module**: Rendering state and quality settings

## Implementation Notes
The Game State Module in Godot leverages:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: GameStateManager as global singleton using Godot's autoload system
2. **State Machine**: Robust state management with enter/leave state callbacks
3. **Event System**: Queue-based event processing with delayed state changes
4. **Resource System**: Configuration and difficulty profiles as data-driven resources
5. **Scene System**: State transitions using scene switching
6. **Input System**: Integrated input handling with remappable controls
7. **Save System**: Persistent save game management with metadata
8. **Configuration Management**: Flexible settings system with file persistence

This replaces the C++ game sequence system with Godot's node-based approach while preserving the same state management functionality. The implementation uses Godot's scene tree for state transitions and the resource system for configuration management.

The event system provides decoupled communication between systems, and the input manager handles cross-state input mapping. The save system provides persistent player progress, and the difficulty system scales gameplay appropriately.

The campaign manager handles mission sequencing and progression, while the difficulty manager adjusts gameplay balance. The configuration manager provides a centralized settings system that persists between sessions.

The implementation uses Godot's built-in systems for most functionality, reducing the need for custom implementations while maintaining the same overall architecture and gameplay flow.
