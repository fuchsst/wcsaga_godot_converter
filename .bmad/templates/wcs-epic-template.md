**Next Steps**:
- If "To Do": Prioritize for definition.
- If "Defined": Prioritize for "In Progress" (requires Architecture).
- If "In Progress": Break down into stories (requires Architecture), implement stories.
- If "Done": Validate overall epic completion and impact.

**Quality Check**: Ensure this Epic definition passes the `.bmad/checklists/epic-quality-checklist.md`.
