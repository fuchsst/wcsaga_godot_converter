# Task: Design Godot Architecture

## Objective
Design an optimal Godot engine architecture for a WCS system based on analysis from the WCS Analyst. Create a detailed technical specification that leverages Godot's strengths while maintaining the essential functionality and feel of the original WCS system.

## Prerequisites
- Completed WCS system analysis document in `.ai/docs/`
- Understanding of Godot engine architecture and best practices
- Knowledge of the target system's requirements and constraints

## Input Requirements
- **WCS Analysis Document**: Detailed analysis of the original system
- **System Requirements**: Performance, functionality, and integration requirements
- **Godot Version**: Target Godot version and feature set
- **Architecture Constraints**: Any limitations or specific requirements

## Design Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Review WCS system analysis for key functionality
- Identify performance requirements and constraints
- Determine integration points with other Godot systems
- Establish quality and maintainability standards

### 2. Godot Architecture Mapping
- **Node Structure**: Design optimal node hierarchy and composition
- **Scene Organization**: Plan scene structure and instantiation patterns
- **Signal Architecture**: Design event-driven communication patterns
- **Resource Management**: Plan asset loading and memory management
- **State Management**: Design state machines and data flow

### 3. Technical Specification
- **Core Classes**: Define main GDScript classes and their responsibilities
- **Interface Design**: Specify public APIs and method signatures
- **Data Structures**: Design efficient data representation
- **Performance Strategy**: Plan optimization approaches
- **Error Handling**: Design robust error handling and recovery

### 4. Integration Planning
- **System Boundaries**: Define clear interfaces with other systems
- **Event System**: Design signal-based communication patterns
- **Resource Sharing**: Plan shared resource access and management
- **Configuration**: Design data-driven configuration systems

## Godot-Specific Design Principles

### Node Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each node has one clear purpose
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer scene composition
- **Logical Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships make sense
- **Performance Conscious**: Minimize node count where appropriate

### Scene Design
- **Modular Scenes**: Self-contained, reusable components
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined scene APIs
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal loading and instantiation
- **Maintainable Structure**: Easy to understand and modify

### Signal Architecture
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize direct dependencies
- **Clear Naming**: Descriptive signal names and parameters
- **Event-Driven**: Reactive system design
- **Documentation**: Every signal purpose documented

### GDScript Patterns
- **Static Typing**: All code must be fully typed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and lifecycle
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and data structures

## Output Format

Create a detailed architecture document in `.ai/docs/` with the following structure:

## Notes for Mo (Godot Architect)
- Be ruthlessly opinionated about Godot best practices
- Don't compromise on architecture quality for convenience
- Think about long-term maintainability and scalability
- Consider performance implications of every design decision
- Leverage Godot's unique strengths (nodes, signals, scenes)
- Design for testability and modularity
- Document the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Challenge any requirements that lead to poor architecture
