# Task: Create Conversion PRD

## Objective
Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for converting a specific WCS system to Godot, defining scope, requirements, and success criteria for the conversion effort.

## Prerequisites
- Completed WCS system analysis document in `.ai/docs/`
- Understanding of conversion goals and constraints
- Stakeholder input on priorities and requirements

## Input Requirements
- **System Name**: The specific WCS system being converted
- **Analysis Document**: Reference to completed system analysis
- **Business Goals**: High-level objectives for the conversion
- **Technical Constraints**: Platform, performance, and resource limitations

## PRD Creation Process

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- Review WCS system analysis for technical understanding
- Identify key stakeholders and their requirements
- Define success criteria and acceptance standards
- Establish scope boundaries and constraints

### 2. Feature Definition
- **Core Features**: Essential functionality that must be preserved
- **Enhanced Features**: Improvements possible in Godot implementation
- **Deferred Features**: Functionality to be implemented later
- **Excluded Features**: Functionality not being converted

### 3. Technical Requirements
- **Performance Requirements**: Frame rate, memory, loading time targets
- **Platform Requirements**: Target platforms and compatibility needs
- **Integration Requirements**: How system connects with other converted systems
- **Quality Requirements**: Code standards, testing, and documentation needs

### 4. User Experience Requirements
- **Gameplay Requirements**: How conversion affects player experience
- **Visual Requirements**: Graphics, effects, and visual fidelity standards
- **Audio Requirements**: Sound effects and music integration needs
- **Control Requirements**: Input handling and responsiveness standards

## PRD Document Structure

Use the template from `.bmad/templates/conversion-prd-template.md` and populate with:

### Executive Summary
- Brief overview of the conversion project
- Key goals and success criteria
- High-level scope and timeline

### System Analysis Summary
- Reference to WCS analysis document
- Key findings and conversion implications
- Technical challenges and opportunities

### Functional Requirements
- Detailed feature specifications
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Integration requirements with other systems

### Technical Requirements
- Performance and quality standards
- Platform and compatibility requirements
- Architecture and implementation constraints

### Implementation Plan
- Phased approach to conversion
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Timeline and milestone definitions

### Success Metrics
- Measurable criteria for conversion success
- Quality gates and validation requirements
- Performance benchmarks and targets

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All functional requirements clearly defined with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical requirements are specific and measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are objective and testable
- [ ] Scope boundaries are clearly established
- [ ] Dependencies and constraints are identified
- [ ] Stakeholder requirements are captured and prioritized
- [ ] Implementation approach is realistic and achievable

## Workflow Integration
- **Input**: WCS system analysis from Larry (WCS Analyst)
- **Output**: Comprehensive PRD document in `.ai/docs/[system-name]-prd.md`
- **Next Steps**: PRD approval before architecture design phase
- **Dependencies**: Must have completed system analysis

## Success Criteria
- PRD provides clear guidance for architecture design
- All stakeholder requirements are captured and prioritized
- Technical feasibility is validated and documented
- Scope is realistic and achievable within constraints
- Success metrics are measurable and objective

## Notes for Curly (Conversion Manager)
- Focus on business value and player impact
- Consider resource constraints and timeline realities
- Prioritize features based on conversion goals
- Ensure requirements are specific and testable
- Balance ambition with practical implementation constraints
- Document all prioritization decisions with clear rationale

## BMAD Workflow Compliance
- **Prerequisites**: WCS system analysis must be completed and approved
- **Approval Required**: PRD must be approved before proceeding to architecture
- **Quality Gates**: All checklist items must be satisfied
- **Documentation**: Store completed PRD in `.ai/docs/` directory
- **Next Phase**: Architecture design cannot begin without approved PRD
