# Change Management Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures that changes to WCS-Godot conversion scope, requirements, or architecture are properly evaluated, documented, and implemented without disrupting project quality or workflow.

## Reviewer: Curly (Conversion Manager) & SallySM (Story Manager)
**Usage**: Run this checklist whenever significant changes are proposed to PRDs, architecture, or project scope

## Change Assessment

### Change Identification
- [ ] **Change Description**: Clear, specific description of what is changing
- [ ] **Change Rationale**: Well-documented reason for the change (new requirements, technical discovery, etc.)
- [ ] **Change Scope**: Clearly defined boundaries of what will be affected
- [ ] **Change Urgency**: Priority level and timeline requirements established

### Impact Analysis
- [ ] **PRD Impact**: Assessment of how change affects existing PRDs
- [ ] **Architecture Impact**: Evaluation of architectural changes required
- [ ] **Story Impact**: Analysis of which stories need modification or creation
- [ ] **Implementation Impact**: Assessment of code changes required

## Stakeholder Management

### Communication
- [ ] **Stakeholder Identification**: All affected parties identified
- [ ] **Impact Communication**: Stakeholders informed of change implications
- [ ] **Approval Process**: Required approvals obtained before proceeding
- [ ] **Timeline Communication**: Updated timelines communicated to all parties

### Documentation
- [ ] **Change Request**: Formal change request documented
- [ ] **Decision Record**: Decision rationale and approval documented
- [ ] **Updated Artifacts**: All affected documents updated to reflect changes
- [ ] **Traceability**: Change impact traced through all project artifacts

## Technical Validation

### WCS Compatibility
- [ ] **Feature Parity**: Change maintains WCS gameplay authenticity
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Change doesn't negatively impact performance targets

- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Technical risks identified and mitigation planned

## Workflow Compliance

### BMAD Process
- [ ] **Workflow Adherence**: Change follows BMAD methodology requirements
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: All quality checkpoints maintained
- [ ] **Approval Sequence**: Proper approval sequence followed (PRD → Architecture → Stories)
- [ ] **Documentation Standards**: All documentation meets BMAD standards

### Epic Management
- [ ] **Single Epic Rule**: Change doesn't violate single epic in progress rule
- [ ] **Epic Scope**: Change properly scoped within epic boundaries
- [ ] **Epic Dependencies**: Dependencies properly managed and documented
- [ ] **Epic Timeline**: Realistic timeline established for change implementation

## Implementation Planning

### Resource Planning
- [ ] **Skill Requirements**: Required expertise identified and available
- [ ] **Time Estimation**: Realistic time estimates for change implementation
- [ ] **Priority Adjustment**: Project priorities adjusted to accommodate change
- [ ] **Capacity Planning**: Team capacity assessed for change implementation

### Risk Management
- [ ] **Risk Identification**: All risks associated with change identified
- [ ] **Risk Mitigation**: Mitigation strategies developed for identified risks
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Plan for reverting change if implementation fails
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing plan for change validation

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Unit test updates required for change identified
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Integration test impacts assessed
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Performance test requirements updated
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Regression test scope expanded to cover change

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] **PRD Updates**: PRDs updated to reflect change requirements
- [ ] **Architecture Updates**: Architecture documents updated for change
- [ ] **Story Updates**: Affected stories updated or new stories created
- [ ] **Process Documentation**: Process documentation updated if needed

## Change Implementation

### Execution Plan
- [ ] **Implementation Sequence**: Logical sequence for implementing change
- [ ] **Milestone Definition**: Clear milestones and checkpoints established
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: Mechanism for tracking change implementation progress
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Clear criteria for successful change implementation

### Validation Process
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear acceptance criteria for change completion
- [ ] **Validation Testing**: Comprehensive testing of change implementation
- [ ] **Stakeholder Review**: Stakeholder review and approval of implemented change
- [ ] **Documentation Verification**: All documentation updated and verified

## Checklist Completion

**Change Manager**: _________________ **Date**: _________________

**Change Type**:
- [ ] **Scope Change**: Modification to project scope or requirements
