# Conversion PRD Quality Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures that Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for WCS-Godot conversion meet the highest standards for clarity, completeness, and implementability before architecture design begins.

## Checklist Completion

**Reviewer**: _________________ **Date**: _________________

**PRD System**: _________________

**Review Result**: 
- [ ] **APPROVED**: PRD meets all quality standards and is ready for architecture design
- [ ] **NEEDS REVISION**: Specific issues identified that must be addressed
- [ ] **REJECTED**: Fundamental problems require complete rewrite

**Critical Issues** (if any):
_List any critical issues that must be addressed before approval_

**Recommendations**:
_Document any recommendations for improvement or optimization_

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] **Architecture Design**: PRD approved, ready for Mo (Godot Architect)
- [ ] **Revision Required**: Specific revisions needed before architecture
- [ ] **Additional Analysis**: More WCS system analysis required

**Critical Reminder**: The PRD serves as the foundation for all subsequent work. A poorly defined PRD will lead to poor architecture, poor stories, and poor implementation. Quality here is non-negotiable.
